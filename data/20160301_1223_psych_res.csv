This study seeks to explore whether neuroticism, agreeableness, and conscientiousness moderate the influence of relationship conflict experienced in groups on changes in group members' evaluative cognitions related to teamwork quality (teamwork-related mental models). Data from 216 students, nested in 48 groups were analyzed using a multilevel modeling approach. Our results show that the experience of relationship conflict leads to a negative shift from the pre-task to the post-task teamwork-related mental models. Moreover, the results indicate that conscientiousness buffered the negative association between relationship conflict and the change in teamwork-related mental models. Our results did not support the hypothesized moderating effect of agreeableness and show that the detrimental effect of relationship conflict on the shift in teamwork-related mental models is accentuated for group members scoring low rather than high on neuroticism. These findings open new research venues for exploring the association between personality, coping styles and change in teamwork-related mental models.

As part of a larger social system (the small group) individual members use evaluative cognitions to understand the workings and intricacies of these systems. These evaluative cognitions form their mental model related to teamwork [4] . Group members' engagement with the group task depends on the content of their teamwork-related mental models [4] ; [5] . Because (1) the evaluative cognitions that group members hold in relation to teamwork are important drivers of task engagement and ultimately group performance [5] and (2) personality is one of the most explored predictors of work related attitudes and behaviors [6] ; [7] it becomes important to identify individual differences (in particular personality traits) that influence the development and change of these individual mental models.  Research to date amply documented the association between group members' personality, on the one hand, and team performance [8] – [10] or teamwork quality [11] , on the other hand. A core argument in this vein of research is that personality influences task and interpersonal engagement and ultimately group performance. Although intuitively appealed and abundantly supported by empirical evidence, this claim was often tested by looking at groups in a static manner. Personality does not only influence the engagement in social interactions, but personality traits also generate patterns of interpretation for the social interactions [12] . It is, therefore, meaningful to examine the way in which personality influences the “reading” of the dynamic group climate or in other words group members' individual mental models related to teamwork. Imagine, for example, how different group members perceive and relate to interpersonal frictions and relationship conflict. For a person scoring high on neuroticism, intense, and emotionally laden interpersonal conflicts bear a different significance than for a person scoring low on neuroticism. As such, one should expect personality driven differences in the way group members perceive the quality of interpersonal relations as they unfold in time.  Because relationship conflict reduces teamwork quality [1] and is an important interpersonal stressor associated with group work [13] ; [14] , we build on the differential exposure-reactivity model to argue that personality influences both the engagement in relationship conflict (stress exposure) as well as the coping strategies mobilized to deal with the stress triggered by it (reaction to stress). Therefore, personality is an important contingency of the teamwork mental model changes induced by the experience of relationship conflict in groups. These changes in the teamwork-related mental models (TWMM) reflect a dissonance reduction process, in which group members attempt to reach consistency between two different sets of evaluative cognitions: their original expectations towards teamwork and the evaluative cognitions referring to the teamwork quality experienced during real group work. The experience of relationship conflict increases this dissonance and conscientiousness, agreeableness and neuroticism are important contingencies in this dissonance reduction process as they influence the exposure and reactivity to interpersonal stressors.  Our conceptualization of the interplay between personality and relationship conflict is in line with the situational congruence model [15] and the person-environment fit framework [16] ; [17] as we argue that change in teamwork mental models (the dissonance between expected teamwork quality and real teamwork quality experienced while performing the collective task) is less strong for situations of fit rather than a misfit between group members' personality and a conflicting group climate. In our study we are particularly interested in testing the way in which changes in the TWMM are influenced by the interaction between neuroticism, agreeableness, and conscientiousness, on the one hand, and perceptions of relationship conflict (as indicator of group climate), on the other hand.   Teamwork-related mental models and relationship conflict  Working in groups raises important challenges for organizational members because they have to focus constantly on both interpersonal interactions and the task [18] . Interpersonal interactions in groups often involve conflicts [19] and relationship conflict is an important work stressor in modern organizations [13] ; [14] . Therefore, relationship conflict reflects a negative group context marked by interpersonal frictions, negative emotionality, and task disengagement [14] ; [19] . Meta-analytical findings converge in showing that relationship conflict is detrimental for task performance and satisfaction with the group [18] ; [20] because it involves perceptions of threats to individual or group goals.  Moreover, Chen and colleagues [1] showed that relationship conflict reduces group members' psychological empowerment and their affective commitment to the group, which in turn decrease the likelihood of them engaging in teamwork behaviors. Imagine members of a newly formed group that hold rather positive expectations towards teamwork and they experience relationship conflict after they begin to work on the task. Their evaluative cognitions towards teamwork will become more negative, they will feel less psychologically empowered, less committed to the group and will eventually withdraw from the task. Therefore, the experience of relationship conflict creates discrepancies between the initial positive expectations towards teamwork and the quality of interpersonal interactions unfolding in reality. We argue, therefore, that the relationship conflict is an important teamwork related demand and it increases the cognitive discrepancy between the expected and realized teamwork quality. We, therefore, hypothesize that:  Hypothesis 1: Relationship conflict leads to a negative shift in group members' teamwork-related mental models.   Person-environment fit in groups – reactions to relationship conflict  Person-environment fit models have been extensively used to document the way in which the fit between personality characteristics and various contextual variables at work influence work related behaviors and outcomes [17] and offers a valuable starting point for understanding the fit between personality traits and teamwork requirements. Research to date extensively explored the association between the big five personality dimensions and teamwork quality and performance [8] ; [21] ; [9] . In line with Mount and colleagues [21] and Peeters and colleagues [9] , we argue that successful groups are composed of individuals with specific personality profiles that reflect both task engagement (conscientiousness) and interpersonal orientation (agreeableness). In their meta-analysis, Mount and colleagues [21] showed that conscientiousness, agreeableness, and emotional stability are positively related to performance in jobs involving interpersonal interactions. Their results also show that emotional stability and agreeableness have the strongest association with performance in jobs that involve teamwork. In other words, we could argue that people scoring high on conscientiousness, high on agreeableness, and low on neuroticism fit well with work contexts involving teamwork.  Working together with others in a group poses important demands on individual group members. They have to cope with the challenges associated with the collective task and also with the ones involved by frequent interpersonal interactions [13] . Therefore, in order to cope with the teamwork-related demands, group members need both task-related as well as interpersonal skills and competencies [22] . Although the literature to date explored a variety of proxies for teamwork related demands (ranging from task complexity to communication demands), relationship conflict is, by far, the most widely explored indicator, with both relational and performance correlates. Because it is related with reduced interpersonal satisfaction and decreased collective performance [20] ; [18] , we argue that relationship conflict is a comprehensive indicator of teamwork-related demands. In line with the person-environment fit framework, we focus here on a particular type of personality-demand fit, predicting that members with certain personality profiles cope better with the demands associated with relationship conflict and as such their teamwork mental models are less volatile over time.  In order to clarify the mechanisms at work in this person-environment fit framework, we use the differential exposure-reactivity model of personality and stress [23] . According to this model, group members' personality traits influence their likelihood of engaging in stressful situations (e.g., relationship conflict) as well as the selection of coping mechanisms they use to deal with the stressful consequences of relationship conflict. From the coping strategies summarized in the meta-analysis of Connor-Smith and Flachsbart [24] , four are directly relevant for addressing the negative emotionality associated with relationship conflict in groups. The problem solving coping strategy involves attempts to reduce relationship conflict through careful task planning, keeping track of the progress towards the collective goals and staying engaged with the task. The emotional regulation focus involves the active attempts to reduce the incidence of negative emotions and the appropriate expression of emotional contents. The cognitive restructuring coping refers to ways in which relational frictions are cognitively reframed in order to reduce their negativity. Finally, the focus on negative emotions is an escalation coping strategy that increases the expression of negative emotions and ultimately leads to relationship conflict escalation. Table 1 summarizes the results reported in [24] concerning the association between conscientiousness, agreeableness, and neuroticism, on the one hand, and the above mentioned coping strategies, on the other hand.  10.1371/journal.pone.0110223.t001 Table 1  Conscientiousness, Aggreableness, Neuroticism and their relation with four coping strategies with interpersonal relevance.      Coping strategy  Conscientiousness  Agreableness  Neuroticism      Problem solving  Positive  Positive  Negative    Emotion regulation  Positive  Not significant  Not significant    Cognitive restructuring  Positive  Positive  Negative    Negative emotion focus  Negative  Negative  Positive     Note: The table presents a summary of the results reported in the meta-analysis by Connor-Smith and Flachsbart (2007).  We therefore build on the differential exposure-reactivity model of stress and personality to explore the way in which teamwork related mental models change in time as a function of experienced relationship conflict and we expect that conscientiousness, agreeableness, and neuroticism moderate the relationship between relationship conflict and changes in teamwork related mental models. Our main claim is that the three personality dimensions influence the exposure and reactivity to relationship conflict as an interpersonal stressor and as such they play an important role in reducing the cognitive dissonance between the expectations towards teamwork quality and the evaluative cognitions of real teamwork quality.   Conscientiousness  Conscientious individuals are achievement oriented, orderly, punctual, dependable, self-disciplined and perceived by others as being task-oriented [12] . Group members scoring high on conscientiousness fit well with the task related demands in teamwork as they spend substantial effort on the task and engage in planning and organizing of group work [25] . Moreover, conscientious members fit well with the interpersonal demands and they perform well in activities that require interdependent and smooth interpersonal relationships, as they constantly help other members of the group to perform their tasks [26] ; [27] . Using the terms of the differential exposure-reactivity model [23] , conscientious group member tend to identify and avoid predictable interpersonal stressors [28] , to preserve harmonious interpersonal relations and thus they are less likely to be exposed to the stress associated with relationship conflict.  When however, relationship conflict emerges in interpersonal situations, it generates frustration [14] and recent empirical evidence suggests that conscientious individuals are less likely to translate anger experienced as a consequence of interpersonally frustrating situations into aggression than individuals scoring low on conscientiousness [29] . Moreover, conscientiousness is positively correlated with effortful control [30] and given their high ability of suppressing a dominant response (anger and aggression) conscientious group members do not escalate relationship conflict in groups. Due to their high task orientation, their tendency to predict and avoid stressful interpersonal events as well as their effective strategies of modulating their dominant answers in interpersonal situations, we expect that conscientious group members will engage less in relationship conflict (low stress exposure) and will deploy effective coping strategies when relationship conflict occurs in their interpersonal relations (selection of effective coping strategies). To conclude, relational conflict is expected to deteriorate less the teamwork related mental models for those high rather than low on conscientiousness.  Hypothesis 2: Conscientiousness buffers the association between relationship conflict and negative shift in teamwork-related mental models.   Agreeableness  Agreeable individuals are more likely to display open communication to be cooperative [31] than less agreeable individuals and display a caring orientation [25] . Also, agreeable people are motivated to establish and maintain good social relationships. Agreeable group members may facilitate the process of conflict resolution because they tend to be altruistic, compliant, and modest [31] ; [32] . Moreover, agreeable people tend to maintain social harmony in the group and to reduce within-group competition [33] while group members scoring low on agreeableness could foster interpersonal conflict because they do not pay attention to the needs, concerns and general task related perspectives of the other group members [34] . Therefore, because agreeableness is the personality dimension with the strongest association with the quality of interpersonal relations, it is expected that group members scoring high on agreeableness fit well with the interpersonal demands associated with teamwork. In terms of exposure to relationship conflict, agreeable individuals tend to avoid conflicts and experience less interpersonal stress [12] ; [28] , while in terms of coping, agreeable group members tend to focus on problem solving strategies and cognitive restructuring [24] and by doing so they maintain a positive group climate. Agreeableness is also positively related to effortful cognitive [30] and emotional [35] control, and given these self-regulation reactions, we expect that agreeableness will buffer the change in TWMM associated with aversive relationship conflict.  Hypothesis 3: Agreeableness buffers the association between relationship conflict and negative shift in teamwork-related mental models.   Neuroticism  Neuroticism or low level on emotional stability characterizes people who experience frustration, anxiety and depression that are usually associated with negative performance outcomes [25] . Neurotic individuals are also more sensitive to work-related stress and are less willing to help others [36] . Moreover, people scoring high on neuroticism tend to experience negative emotions [37] . As group members scoring high on neuroticism tend not to express their anger [12] and given that relationship conflict reflects emotionally laden situations, we argue that neuroticism is in misfit with relationship conflict demands. Neuroticism is also positively related with stress exposure and an ineffective selection of coping strategies [28] ; [24] and group members scoring high on neuroticism are expected to experience a higher dissonance between their teamwork related expectations and the way the evaluate teamwork under high relationship conflict conditions. We therefore expect that group members scoring high on neuroticism tend to experience a significant drop in their positive perceptions of TWMM when relationship conflict increases. For members scoring low on neuroticism (emotionally stable group members) the decrease in the teamwork related mental models evaluation while experiencing relationship conflict is expected to be lower because they are more secure, calm, steady, and may engage stronger with teamwork [10] and can cope more effectively with the stress induced by relationships conflict [28] . Therefore we hypothesize that:  Hypothesis 4: Neuroticism accentuates the association between relationship conflict and negative shift in teamwork-related mental models.   Method   Ethics statement  The experimental procedures were approved by the Institutional Review Board at the West University of Timisoara, No 12675/2014. All participants gave their informed written consent to participate in the study.   Participants and design  Participants were 216 students (83% women, with an average age of 20.75 years old) organized in 48 groups having 3 to 6 members. They were asked to participate in a creative group exercise. Their task was to use six drinking straws of equal sizes, a one meter long plastic strip, a duct tape and a plastic bowl to build a device that would prevent a dropped egg from breaking. Participants were asked to fill out two questionnaires one before and one after the creative task. Before actively engaging in the exercise the participants were asked to fill out a personality questionnaire (NEO FFI, [32] ) and a questionnaire evaluating their teamwork quality expectations [4] . After finishing the task, the participants were asked to fill out the same questionnaire used to evaluate their teamwork related mental models, only this time the items referred to how they perceived teamwork quality in their own group and the amount of relationship conflict experienced in their group.   Measures  The big five personality dimensions were evaluated with NEO Five Factor Inventory (NEO-FFI; [32] ). This is a questionnaire that assesses each factor with 12 items rated on a five-point Likert scale. We used the Romanian version of the NEO-FFI by [38] , who reported a satisfactory level of internal consistency (around.90 for all factors) and strong empirical support for the validity of the scales.  Teamwork-related mental models (TWMM) were evaluated using an individual teamwork expectations measure (pre-task) developed by Eby and colleagues [4] consisting of 28 items. Prior to the task engagement, participants were asked to rate their expectation concerning the way they will work together in the group (pre-task TWMM) and examples of items include: “Members share information with each other”. Answers were recorded on a 5 points Likert scale (1 =  strongly disagree to 5 =  strongly agree ) and α = .91 for our sample. After finishing the creative task, each participant was asked to fill out the same items, but this time reflecting the way they actually worked together on the task (post-task TWMM). This scale has the same structure as the teamwork expectations scale but items were reframed to evaluate actual teamwork quality, e.g. “Members shared information with each other” (28 items; α = .88 post-task for our sample). The change in teamwork related mental models (TWMM) is calculated as the difference between TWMM assessment in the post-task and TWMM expectations in the pre-task.  Relationship conflict (RC) was assessed using a four item scale developed by Jehn [19] . Answers were recorded on a 5 points Likert scale (1 =  never to 5 =  very often ) and examples of items include: “How often did you experience personality clashes between group members while working on the task?”. The internal consistency of the relationship conflict measure was.73 for our sample.  The interpersonal acquaintance level between group members (Acq) was assessed by asking each participant to rate how well he/she is acquainted with the other group members, using a 1 to 10 Likert scale (1 not at all –10 very well). For each participant we averaged the score of all evaluations to obtain an average acquaintance level of each individual with the rest of the group members. The Acq was used to control for any effects that might be attributed to this variable.   Analyses  Given the nested nature of our data, we used a multilevel modeling approach. This decision is supported by the fact that the criterion variable (TWMM) is dependent both on individual characteristics and on the particular experience shared by all members of each specific group. Therefore we analyzed the data using a two-level model, in order to account for the non-independence of observations (the data sets used for the two levels are presented: level 1 data set is labeled “ Data S1 ” and level 2 data set is labeled “ Data S2 ”). At the individual level, we estimated intercept-only regression equations. These intercepts were used at the group level, for the prediction of TWMM change. Because we expected level-1 intercepts to vary randomly from one group to another, we conducted a group-level random-intercept analysis . For the multilevel analyses we used the hierarchical linear modeling (HLM) framework and performed our analyses with HLM 7 [39] .   Results  Means, standard deviation and correlations for the variables considered in the study are presented in Table 2 . In order to simplify the interpretation of results and to reduce multicollinearity, all predictors were grand-mean centered before further analyses. We controlled for the level of interpersonal acquaintance in order to exclude the possibility that previous interpersonal interactions influence the individual expectations toward teamwork and biased the estimation of TWMM change. Interpersonal acquaintance was group mean centered before the analyses. For identification of moderation effects, we computed the cross-product vector of the predictors (relationship conflict with conscientiousness, agreeableness and neuroticism). Then, we included these three interaction terms as predictors into the level-1 equation. At the level 2 of the analysis, we expected that changes in TWMM will vary randomly from one group to another; therefore we assumed a random intercept model ( Equation 2 ). However, we assumed that the relationships between predictors and the criterion will remain the same from one group to another, therefore we assumed a fixed slopes model ( Equations 3 to 10 ).  10.1371/journal.pone.0110223.t002 Table 2  Means, standard deviations and correlations between variables at individual level.

(N = 216).  Level 1 equation (Equation \;1)  Level 2 equations (Equation 2) (Equation 3) (Equation 4) (Equation 5) (Equation 6) (Equation 7) (Equation 8) (Equation 9) (Equation 10)   Correlations between study variables, at individual level  Results presented in Table 2 indicated significant correlations between change in TWMM and conscientiousness ( r  = 0.13, p <.05), on the one hand, and relationship conflict (RC) ( r  = −0.22, p <.01), on the other hand. The correlations between the change in TWMM and Neuroticism were marginally significant ( r  = −0.11, p  = .08), and not significant with Agreeableness (r = 0.03, p>.05). Although these two variables were not significantly associated with change in TWMM, we included them into further analyses to investigate whether they act as moderators between RC and change in TWMM.   The null model  In the first step of the multilevel analysis, we examined variance components using the null model (equations for both levels with only intercepts), in order to see how the variance of perceived TWMM change is partitioned between the two levels of analysis. Results indicated that 17.9% of the change in TWMM variance lies between groups and the intercepts vary significantly between groups (Wald Z = 2.34, p <.05). Taken together, these results indicated that a multilevel approach is adequate for the analysis of our data.   The group level random intercept model  The results of the multilevel analysis are presented in Table 3 . Regarding the direct effects, RC was a significant predictor of change in TWMM (γ 40  = −0.28, t  = −2.39, p <.05), indicating that individuals in groups that experienced high RC significantly decreased their post-task evaluation of the TWMM, as compared with their pre-task expectation of TWMM. Therefore Hypothesis 1 is fully supported. The relations between personality variables and change in TWMM were significant in the case of Conscientiousness (γ 30  = 0.01, t  = 2.33, p <.05), and not significant in the case of Neuroticism and Agreeableness. The level of between-participants acquaintance had little impact on the overall results, because (a) it was not correlated with any of the variables included in the analysis, and (b) it did not predict significantly the change in TWMM.  10.1371/journal.pone.0110223.t003 Table 3  Multilevel results for the prediction of TWMM change.

As the interaction between agreeableness and RC is not significant, we can conclude that Hypothesis 3 is not supported. The multilevel analysis indicated the presence of two significant moderation effects. First, the interaction term between conscientiousness and RC was statistically significant (γ 70  = 0.036, t  = 2.60, p <.05). This moderation effect is presented in Figure 1 , and indicated that a negative association between RC and change in TWMM can be found only in the case of group members scoring low on conscientiousness, but not in the case of individuals scoring high on conscientiousness. Therefore, Hypothesis 2 was fully supported by the data.  10.1371/journal.pone.0110223.g001 Figure 1  The Moderation Effect of Conscientiousness on the Relation between Relationship Conflict and TWMM Change.  Note: TWMM change reflects the difference in teamwork-related mental models (TWMM post-task minus TWMM pre-task).   Second, the cross-product term between neuroticism and RC was statistically significant (γ 50  = 0.03, t  = 3.23, p <.01), indicating that the association between RC and change in TWMM is also moderated by neuroticism. This moderation effect is presented in Figure 2 , and showed that a negative correlation between RC and change in TWMM can be found only in the case of group members with low levels of neuroticism, and not in the case of group members with high levels of neuroticism. Although the interaction effect is significant, it reveals a different effect of the interplay between neuroticism and RC than expected in Hypothesis 4. The slopes of this interaction are presented in Figure 2 .  10.1371/journal.pone.0110223.g002 Figure 2  The Moderation Effect of Neuroticism on the Relation between Relationship Conflict and TWMM Change.  Note: TWMM change reflects the difference in teamwork-related mental models (TWMM post-task minus TWMM pre-task).   Discussion  This study used a multilevel perspective on groups to test the extent to which personality moderates the deteriorating effect of relationship conflict on change in TWMM. As expected our results show that the experience of relationship conflict deteriorates TWMM supporting the claim that intra-group conflict is an important stressor in groups [13] ; [40] . Building on a person-environment fit perspective we argued that high conscientiousness, high agreeableness, and low neuroticism reflect a good fit between the group members and the teamwork related demands as captured by relationship conflict. We argued that when group members experience relationship conflict, high conscientiousness, high agreeableness and low neuroticism facilitate the dissonance reduction process responsible for attenuating the discrepancy between TWMM in the pre-task and post task conditions. Our results support the claim that conscientiousness is a buffer that reduces the detrimental effects of relationship conflict on TWMM and shows that relationship conflict decreases the favorable evaluations of teamwork quality only for those group members scoring low on conscientiousness. This result is in line with previous findings showing that the personality has the potential to affect employees' perceptions and appraisals of the work related environment, their causal attributions for work related events [41] . In line with the attentional-resource perspective, we argue that high relationship conflict alters attributions that group members make about each others' actions and behaviors during teamwork [42] . When experiencing relationship conflict, group members scoring low on conscientiousness will most probably translate anger into aggression, withdraw from the task and their disengagement and aggression decreases the quality of teamwork interactions and consequently their perceptions of teamwork quality will deteriorate in the post-task condition. Conscientious group members, on the other hand, are more likely to tackle interpersonal issues associated with relationship conflict, stay focused and help others focus on the task. Moreover, conscientious group members have a high capacity for cognitive control and they are effective in cognitive restructuring attempts [28] therefore they report almost no shift in teamwork related mental models attributable to relationship conflict.  Our results did not support the moderating role of agreeableness. The key argument was that agreeableness influences the process of dissonance reduction in the TWMM change through the engagement with relationship conflict as an interpersonal stressor and the selection of effective coping strategies. This argument is in line with the claim that the interpersonal processes associated with agreeableness are the result of cognitive self-regulation mechanisms and not just with conformity and social desirability [29] . A possible explanation for the lack of support for Hypothesis 3 can be that the student group evaluated in this research worked together for a short period of time. As the groups were in principle formed for just one task and the group members had no foreseeable future interactions, agreeableness apparently was less important for buffering the negative effect of relationship conflict on TWMM change. The degree of group permanency influences the use of emotion regulation strategies in dealing with conflict [43] and it is not unreasonable to argue that people scoring high on agreeableness will mobilize their emotion regulation and effortful control strategies only when they expect future interpersonal interactions with their group members. Agreeableness therefore did not influence the dissonance reduction process associated with the experience of relationship conflict in groups. A valuable direction for future research is to explore the way in which the degree of group permanency influences the relationship between agreeableness and cognitive change induced by relationship conflict. Future research could also attempt to disentangle the association between agreeableness and the deployment of response focused (short term perspective) versus antecedent focused (long term perspective) emotion regulation strategies triggered by the experience of relationship conflict.  With respect to neuroticism, we hypothesized that the association between relationship conflict and decrease in teamwork-related mental models is higher for emotionally unstable individuals. Opposed to our expectations, we found that group members scoring low on neuroticism report a negative association between relationship conflict and teamwork-related mental models. Emotional stability seems, therefore, not to play the buffering role we expected. One alternative explanation is that the group members scoring high on neuroticism are less likely to express their anger while being engaged in relationship conflict and this could prevent the further escalation of relationship conflict. Another alternative explanation refers to the tendency of people scoring high on neuroticism to adopt an emotion focused coping strategy [44] that will eventually help them to cope with the negative emotionality associated with relationship conflict [14] . This would explain why for people scoring high on neuroticism the change in the teamwork related mental model is as strongly influenced by the relationship conflict as for people scoring low on neuroticism. The teamwork related mental model for people scoring high on neuroticism seems to fall below their original expectations independent of the level of relationship conflict experienced (see the regression slope in Figure 2 ). For emotionally stable group members, the post-task teamwork mental model exceeds their pre-task expectations when they experience less rather than more relationship conflict. An explanation could be their involvement in the conflict and as they engage in relational frictions with others they lose their task focus, and as a consequence they report that their teamwork quality expectations are not met by the real group interactions. This counter-intuitive result most certainly warrants some further exploration and the way in which neuroticism relates to relationship conflict and conflict management in groups further extend our understanding of the interplay between personality and conflict in groups.   Limitations and future research directions  Several limitations of the present study should be noted. First, we have to acknowledge the low number of groups with a short life span. Also, our study is limited in its ecological validity because the activity of student groups was performed in laboratory, not in real life environment. Thus, a replication of our study in established work group could further examine if agreeableness buffers the negative effects of relationship conflict on teamwork mental models. The relationship conflict and teamwork mental models measures were collected from group members using a self-report questionnaire. Separating the evaluations in time helped us to reduce the problems associated with common method variance. In terms of practical implications, our results show that conscientious group members successfully cope with relationship conflicts without altering their teamwork related mental models. Thus, conscientiousness is not only a good predictor of job performance, but it is also a good predictor for the adaptability of individuals in work groups. Further research should more directly address the plausible link between personality, preferred coping style, and relationship conflict. As literature to date started to explore the association between preferred coping styles in groups and relationship conflict [14] , future research could extend this stream of literature by testing the extent to which coping styles mediate the association between personality dimensions and conflict escalation and transformation in groups.

The authors evaluate the quality of research reported in major journals in social-personality psychology by ranking those journals with respect to their N -pact Factors (NF)—the statistical power of the empirical studies they publish to detect typical effect sizes. Power is a particularly important attribute for evaluating research quality because, relative to studies that have low power, studies that have high power are more likely to (a) to provide accurate estimates of effects, (b) to produce literatures with low false positive rates, and (c) to lead to replicable findings. The authors show that the average sample size in social-personality research is 104 and that the power to detect the typical effect size in the field is approximately 50%. Moreover, they show that there is considerable variation among journals in sample sizes and power of the studies they publish, with some journals consistently publishing higher power studies than others. The authors hope that these rankings will be of use to authors who are choosing where to submit their best work, provide hiring and promotion committees with a superior way of quantifying journal quality, and encourage competition among journals to improve their NF rankings.   The authors have no funding or support to report. Data Availability The authors confirm that all data underlying the findings are fully available without restriction. All data used in this report are available from the Open Science Framework database (osf.io/7im3n). info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0109019.g002  Introduction  Most researchers in psychology strive to publish their best work in highly regarded journals. Publishing in a top journal is considered a mark of accomplishment, and articles that appear in reputable journals are more likely to be recognized and cited by one's colleagues. Moreover, it is not uncommon for search and promotion committees to judge a researcher's work on the reputation of the journals in which he or she publishes.  But how do we know whether a given journal has a track record of publishing high-quality research? The most common way to quantify the quality of scientific journals in psychology is with respect to their citation Impact Factors (IF; such as the Thomson Reuters Journal Citation Reports)—an index of how often articles published in those journals are cited. Although impact factors are widely used in academia, their use is controversial [1] – [4] . Some critics, for example, have questioned whether the impact of research is appropriately indexed over a relatively short time span (i.e., the two years following publication) compared to longer time spans [5] . In addition, a number of critics have argued that citation rates per se may not reflect anything informative about the quality of empirical research. A paper can receive a large number of citations in the short run because it reports surprising, debatable, or counter-intuitive findings regardless of whether the research was conducted in a rigorous manner. In other words, the short-term citation rate of a journal may not be particularly informative concerning the quality of the research it reports.  The “quality” of a research study, however, can be an elusive thing to quantify. And, as scholars have demonstrated, different scientists evaluating the same manuscripts do not always agree on the quality of the work in question [6] . Thus, one challenge for the field is to develop useful ways to index the quality of published empirical research. Such indices would help researchers and promotion committees better evaluate various journals, allow the public and the press (i.e., consumers of scientific knowledge in psychology) to have a better appreciation of the credibility of published research, and perhaps even facilitate competition among journals in a way that would improve the net quality of published research.  One potentially valuable way to index the quality of empirical research is with respect to the statistical power of research designs to detect the average effect in a research area. Statistical power is defined as the probability of detecting an effect of interest when that effect actually exists [7] . Statistical power is relevant for judging the quality of empirical research literatures because, compared to lower powered studies, studies that are highly powered are more likely to (a) detect valid effects, (b) buffer the literature against false positives, and (c) produce findings that other researchers can replicate. In short, the more power a study has, the better positioned it is to provide precise knowledge and make robust contributions to the empirical literature.  All else being equal, we believe that journals that publish empirical studies based on highly powered designs should be regarded as more prestigious and credible scientific outlets than those that do not. As such, we introduce a new index, called the N-pact Factor (NF), that can be used to rank journals with respect to the statistical power of the empirical studies they publish. To illustrate the utility of the NF, we examine empirical studies published in six well-regarded journals in social and personality psychology. We demonstrate that, overall, the statistical power of studies published in these journals tends to be inadequate by conventional standards. Moreover, we show that there is considerable variation among journals; some journals tend to consistently publish higher power studies and have lower estimated false positive rates than others. And, importantly, we show that some journals, despite their comparatively high impact factors, publish studies that are greatly underpowered for scientific research in psychology.  Although we focus in this article on the power researchers choose for their studies as a means for evaluating the quality of empirical research, we wish to be clear from the outset that it is not our intent to argue that statistical power is the only indicator of research quality. There are many ingredients involved in high quality research. A high quality study, for example, should be capable of addressing a theoretically or practically important problem. It should involve reasonable and established methods for assessing the constructs of interest. The relationship between theory and measurement should be explicit and clear. And the data should be analyzed in a competent manner. We focus on statistical power over these other factors for at least three reasons. First, one of the fundamental ingredients in the calculation of statistical power, sample size or N , can be objectively coded with little interpretational ambiguity. Although researchers, reviewers, and editors may disagree on whether the research questions addressed in an article are important or interesting, there is little room for debate on whether the sample size used to answer those questions was 25 vs. 225. Second, although power is only relevant in the context of null hypothesis significance testing (NHST), NHST, despite its detractors, remains the dominant way in which psychological scientists go about making decisions regarding statistical hypotheses. As we discuss later, sample size, which varies perfectly with power for a given effect size, is a more robust way to conceptualize these problems and, as a result, we emphasize sample size and power in the current report. Finally, the use of underpowered designs fundamentally undermines the integrity of scientific research. As we explain in more detail below, many of the problems that currently confront the field (e.g., the file drawer problem, the replicability crisis) stem in part from inadequate attention to statistical power. By using statistical power as a means for evaluating the quality of research published in empirical journals, we hope to call greater attention to the role it plays in the credibility of empirical research.  In short, we focus on statistical power because it is a fundamental ingredient in high quality research. It is our hope that the NF will provide a way for committees, scholars, and consumers to evaluate the quality of empirical journals based on a criterion other than citation rate alone. More importantly, however, we hope that an explicit ranking of the quality of empirical journals—something similar to a Consumer Reports ranking of journals—will help create incentives for journals and editorial boards to value higher power research designs when those designs are viable.   Why Is Statistical Power Important for Research Quality?  Statistical power refers to the probability that a study will be able to find a statistically significant result when, in fact, the null hypothesis is false. Why is power necessary for high quality research? In the sections that follow we discuss three problems that can emerge when empirical studies are not designed in a manner that is sensitive to statistical power.   Limitation 1. Low Power Studies are Less Capable of Detecting True Relationships  The most obvious limitation of under-powered research is that such research lacks the ability to detect true effects. In many situations in scientific psychology it is not uncommon for researchers to design a study to test a theoretically compelling hypothesis, but to design the study in such a way that the research only has a 50% chance of correctly detecting the effect if, in fact, the effect exists [7] – [8] . The costs of engaging in under-powered research are substantial. From a scientific perspective, the field misses out on the opportunity to learn more about valid, but undetected, statistical relationships—relationships that might be critical for evaluating competing theories, laying the groundwork for a new substantive area, or advancing potential interventions.  There are also costs from a human factors perspective. Part of the thrill of science is conducting research for the purposes of solving problems, discovering new things, and rigorously evaluating alternative theoretical predictions. When young researchers attempt to build knowledge via a process that has an accuracy rate that is no better than a coin flip, research begins to resemble a gamble; the study either “works” (i.e., the researcher “gets lucky”) or “doesn't work.” And when studies do not work, the research process can be demoralizing and potentially career-altering for otherwise talented graduate students and assistant professors who are trying to build a track record of publications.  In contrast, when research is designed to have high power from the outset, the research is better positioned to produce useful knowledge. Moreover, when a well-powered study “fails” to find a significant result, even that so-called “failure” provides useful scientific knowledge [9] . On average, journals that publish studies based on larger sample sizes are more likely than those that do not to provide useful knowledge to the field.   Limitation 2. Literatures Based on Underpowered Studies have a Greater Proportion of False Positive Findings  A common misconception concerning statistical power is that power is irrelevant once the results are in and the findings have been shown to be statistically significant. According to this logic, sample size and statistical power might be worth considering at the research design stage, but, once a significant result has been found, it is no longer meaningful to ask whether the study had the power to detect the finding. If a significant result was found, the study was capable, ipso facto , of detecting it. There is no point in wondering whether a study that “worked” had the power to do so, nor is there much point in faulting a study that “worked” by referencing its relative lack of power.  What is not recognized among many researchers, however, is that low power studies that “work” can dramatically increase the proportion of false positives in the broader literature. In other words, the Type I error rate in a collection of studies is not determined by the alpha rate (5%) alone. The false positive rate among published studies is also a function of the average power of those studies. As the power of the typical study decreases, the ratio of false positives to true positives increases [10] , [11] .  This point is best understood with respect to a concrete example. Assume that, in a specific area of research, the null hypothesis has an a priori probability of being correct about half the time. Assume that researchers conduct 100 studies. In 50 of those studies researchers are testing hypotheses that are true and in 50 of them researchers are testing hypotheses that are false. Given an alpha rate of 5%, this implies that, among the 50 studies in which the researchers are testing research hypotheses that are false, 2.5 of those will produce Type I errors on average (i.e., 50×.05 = 2.5).  Does this mean that fewer than 5% of published findings in a literature are false positives? Not exactly. If we assume that only statistically significant findings are published—a simplifying assumption that is not too far from the truth [12] —then the proportion of significant findings that are false positives in the literature is equal to the number of false positives relative to the total number of published significant results (i.e., the bottom row in Table 1 ). This latter quantity is a function not only of alpha but also of statistical power.  10.1371/journal.pone.0109019.t001 Table 1  Correct and Incorrect Conclusions in NHST.       REALITY    CONCLUSION  Null hypothesis is true  Research hypothesis is true      Null hypothesis is true  A. Correct rejection (probability  =  1 – α)  C. Type II error (probability  =  β)    Research hypothesis is true  B. Type I error (probability  =  α)  D. Correct hit (probability  =  1 - β)(power)     Note . In Null Hypothesis Significance Testing (NHST), the null hypothesis of no effect or no difference is either true (cells A and B) or false (cells C and D). When the null hypothesis is true (i.e., the left-hand column), it is possible for a researcher to make an incorrect decision by obtaining a significant result and rejecting the null hypothesis (cell B). The probability of this happening is equal to α and is set to 5%, by convention, to help minimize the false positive. When the null hypothesis is false (i.e., the right-hand column), the researcher can make a correct decision by obtaining a significant result (cell D). The probability of this happening is (1 – β), or the statistical power of the test. When the null hypothesis is false, one can make an inferential error by failing to obtain a significant result (cell C). This error rate is defined as beta (β) and is commonly referred to as Type II error.  To see how this plays out, let us assume that the statistical power of a typical study is 20%. In such a situation, approximately 10 of the 50 studies in which the null hypothesis is false will yield significant results (i.e., 50×.20). Thus, the number of false positives relative to the total number of published significant findings is 20% (i.e., false positives/(false positives + correct hits)  =  2.5/(2.5+10)). That is, one out of every five published finding will be a false positive.  Consider how things would play out if the statistical power of a typical study in a research area were 80% instead of 20%. In this case, 40 of the 50 studies in which the null hypothesis is false will produce significant results (50×.80). The number of false positives remains the same (5% of 50, or 2.5). Thus, the number of correct hits (40) relative to the total number of significant results (42.5) is much higher than before: 94%. The proportion of false positives (6%) in the literature slightly exceeds the nominal 5% alpha level, but, comparatively speaking, the literature is of much higher quality than in the previous example in which the statistical power of a typical study was 20%.  The important point here is that there are fewer false positives in a literature composed of high power studies than a literature composed of low power studies . Indeed, when the statistical power of studies in a literature is low, the proportion of false positives published in that literature can be surprisingly high [13] . In contrast to conventional wisdom, statistical power does not become irrelevant once the results of a given study are known. Statistical power is absolutely crucial for ensuring that the knowledge being produced by a field is accurate. As such, journals that publish studies based on higher power designs are less likely to publish false positives, on average.   Limitation 3. Under-Powered Studies are Less Capable of Producing Replicable Findings  One of the defining features of the scientific method is replication. Scientists assume that, if a researcher reports an empirical finding, other researchers using similar methods will be able to reproduce it. Scientists acknowledge that there can be errors in this process (i.e., even correct observations may not be replicated for a variety of reasons, including unknown moderators), but scientists nonetheless consider replicable findings to be more credible than findings that have yet to be replicated (e.g., due to lack of trying or due to failures to replicate despite earnest attempts to do so).  Statistical power plays a crucial role in replicability. Assume that some variable, Y , truly differs between two groups, such that the population effect size is d  = .50. Moreover, assume that a researcher seeks to test this difference by sampling 32 people from Group 1 and 32 people from Group 2. The power of this design to detect the effect of interest is approximately 50%. That is, the researcher has a 50-50 chance of correctly rejecting the null hypothesis.  Let us further assume that the researcher gets lucky and the effect in his or her sample happens to be statistically significant. How likely is it that this researcher or another researcher will be able to replicate the finding that Y differs significantly between the two groups? Many researchers intuitively base their judgments of replicability on the p -value from the significance test: If the p -value is small (e.g., p <.001), the effect should be replicable [14] . However, as has been noted by many methodologists [14] , the replicability of a finding is dependent on the statistical power of the design and not the outcome of a significance test from any one study. If a second researcher uses the same design and sample size, theoretically, he or she also has a 50% chance of detecting the effect. (Fortunately, recent systematic replication efforts in social psychology have used sample sizes that are larger than those used in the original studies [15] , .) The power of a design, in other words, is statistically independent of the outcome of any one study [17] .  The implications of this are profound. If a researcher attempts to replicate a perfectly valid effect using a design that only has 50% power, then he or she only has a 50% chance of detecting the true effect. Moreover, the probability that any two studies on the topic (e.g., an original study and a follow up study) will both produce statistically significant results is only 25% (i.e., .50 × .50). This suggests that, regardless of the veracity of the theories being tested, a research domain based on underpowered studies is likely to be full of “failures to replicate” and “inconsistent findings” [18] . Without taking power seriously, the cause of failed replications is ambiguous. The failures to replicate could be due to studying small effects with underpowered designs or they could be due to the invalidity of the focal hypothesis.  Again, the costs of this problem have the potential to be substantial for the field. For young researchers who are attempting to build on existing findings in the literature, the failure to use a highly powered design can lead them to fail to replicate the basic effect they are attempting to build upon (assuming it is not a false positive; see Limitation # 2), potentially stifling their careers and job prospects. Moreover, failures to replicate published findings have the potential to undermine the public's trust in scientific research in psychology, as has been witnessed in recent years in psychology [19] . It is possible that the so-called replication crisis or crisis of confidence in psychology [20] is an artifact of a long history of researchers using under-powered designs—a state of affairs that is guaranteed to reduce the odds that published findings can be replicated.  Most educated people have the intuition that science is a cumulative and self-correcting enterprise, involving a healthy dose of false starts, complete misses, and unbridled ambiguity. But if an overwhelming proportion of published research findings are not replicable simply due to power issues (i.e., problems that are under the direct control of researchers and the editorial standards of the journals in which they publish) rather than the uncertainty inherent in human behavior, then people have little reason to take psychological science seriously. In short, compared to journals that publish lower powered studies, journals that publish higher power studies are more likely to produce findings that are replicable—a quality that should factor into the reputations of scientific journals. Journals that choose to publish under-powered studies are indirectly contributing to the crisis of confidence in psychology.  (As a side note, it should be noted that Gregory Francis has examined power problems, but from the other direction [21] . Although most scholars would likely question the quality of research literature that produces heterogeneous estimates of an effect based on low powered studies, Francis has astutely noted that the appearance of more replications than is expected on the basis of statistical power is an indicator of publication bias. Simply put, if the power of a typical study is 50% and 10 studies are conducted, the odds that all 10 studies will produce significant results is .50 10 or about 1 in a 1000. Thus, if 10 out of 10 underpowered studies in an area (or in a single report) report significant results, then that is an incredible set of findings indeed. Schimmack [22] has explicitly created an index called the Incredibility Index that quantifies this particular property in research literatures. To be clear, it is not the case that a series of replicated findings per se is indicative of publication bias. If studies are adequately powered, it is quite reasonable for all of them to all produce statistically significant results. For example, at 90% power, we would expect 9/10 studies, on average, to be statistically significant. But at 50% power, we would not expect 9/10 studies to produce statistically significant findings.)   Methods and Results  The aims of this article are to introduce a new metric for ranking journal quality based on the statistical power of studies published in a given journal and to use that metric to compare the power of studies published in some of the top journals in social/personality psychology. It has long been known that the sample size, and accordingly, the statistical power, of research studies in psychology is low [7] . Moreover, despite repeated calls for methodological reform, previous studies suggest that such calls have gone unheeded. For example, when Sedlmeier and Gigerenzer [8] surveyed the statistical power of studies published more than 20 years after Cohen's original critique, they found that the typical power of studies had not changed (see [24] , [25] for further discussion). We believe that explicitly ranking journals based on power may help incentivize journals, and therefore researchers, to increase their sample sizes. At the very least, we hope such rankings will help make the issue of statistical power more salient in the evaluation of empirical research.  To illustrate the NF, we examine six of the top journals in social and personality psychology (i.e., Journal of Experimental Social Psychology [JESP], Journal of Personality [JP], Journal of Personality and Social Psychology [JPSP], Journal of Research in Personality [JRP], Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin [PSPB], and Psychological Science [PS])). Although our long-term goal is to evaluate journals against one another within a variety of subfields in psychology, we focus on social/personality psychology in this article for two reasons. First, as social and personality psychologists, we wanted our initial investigation into these issues to probe the domains with which we are most familiar. Second, because many contemporary debates and discussions regarding the “replicability crisis” concern research in social psychology (see [26] , [13] , [20] ), we thought it would be particularly useful to begin by indexing the relative quality of journals in this area. We focused on these journals in particular because they are generally regarded as the top empirical journals in social/personality psychology in North America. We recognize that there are some important social/personality journals that were not included in this report (e.g., the European Journal of Social Psychology and the European Journal of Personality). We hope to include these and other journals in our future surveys. We report all journals we coded, with the exception of Social Psychological and Personality Science, which does not have a Thomson Reuters impact factor yet, and has only been in circulation since 2010.  We operationalize the NF for a journal in a given year as the median sample size of the studies it publishes within that year . Although we have organized our discussion up to this point around statistical power rather than sample size per se , we use the metric of sample size for the NF rather than power in this particular report for three reasons. First, and most importantly, the metric of sample size is intuitive and can be widely understood by researchers, administrators, and the lay public, regardless of differences in exposure to the technical issues related to statistical power. Second, as we explain later, N is a useful way of computing both statistical power and the precision of parameter estimates (e.g., confidence intervals). Thus, whether one is an advocate of NHST or not, sample size is a useful and meaningful metric. Finally, for a given effect size, N and statistical power are perfectly correlated. As such, for the purposes of evaluating journals relative to one another , the information contained in average sample sizes and average power estimates is identical. Although we use N as the metric for the NF, we nonetheless use this information to derive power estimates and false positive rate estimates for each of the journals under consideration.  The use of sample size as our primary metric for indexing the quality of empirical research, however, raises an important issue. Namely, if certain journals tend to publish research that naturally focuses on large effect sizes, then those journals would be at a disadvantage with respect to the NF. Although those journals might publish studies that are, in fact, highly powered, they will fare poorly on the NF because the studies they publish might not need large samples to detect large effects with high power.  This is a valid concern. We do not doubt that there are some labs within social and personality psychology that are investigating larger effects than others. The “many labs” project [27] , for example, provides compelling evidence that effect size estimates for certain anchoring problems are large ( d  = 2.42) compared to effect size estimates for other issues (e.g., the association between imagined contact and prejudice; d  = 0.13). The most pertinent question for the present purposes, however, is whether this state of affairs varies systematically across journals in social/personality psychology. The journals we are examining are relatively broad in their scope, focusing on a variety of questions of interest to social and personality psychologists. We do not have any reason to believe that some social/personality journals are more likely than others to specifically publish research in domains in which the effect sizes are intrinsically larger than others.  The most salient substantive distinction among these journals is whether they bill themselves as being relevant to social psychology (e.g., JESP ), personality psychology (e.g., JP ), or both (e.g., PSPB ). Thus, one way to frame the problem is to ask whether prototypical studies in social psychology tend to examine effects that are larger than those in personality psychology, either in virtue of the population effect sizes themselves or via the methods that are used to study them (e.g., experimental vs. correlational; see [28] ). A quantitative analysis of research in social and personality psychology by Richard, Bond, and Stokes-Zoota [29] , however, suggests that published effect sizes are comparable across these subfields. Specifically, Richard and colleagues [29] analyzed data from over 25,000 social/personality studies of 8 million people and found that the average effect size was equivalent to a Pearson correlation of .21 (a Cohen's d of .43). Moreover, although there was substantial variation in the effect size estimates across studies ( SD  = .15), this variation was not moderated by subfield; the average effect size of situational effects ( r  = .22) was similar to that of person effects ( r  = .19) (see also [30] and [31] ). These kinds of findings indicate that, although some research areas might be concerned with larger effects than other areas, there is little reason to believe that these differences vary systematically across the non-specialty journals in social/personality psychology.  For each journal and for each year, starting in 2006 and ending in 2010, we drew a random sample of 20% of published empirical articles. In total, we coded 1,934 studies that were distributed across 824 articles. Two coders recorded the sample size of each empirical study reported in those articles. In cases where the two coders differed in their estimates by more than N  = 30, the first author examined the studies in question and resolved the discrepancy. We excluded meta-analytic studies because our intention was to capture the sample sizes used by researchers when they have the freedom to choose their sample sizes. In meta-analysis, those choices are not made by the meta-analyst, but by the authors of the primary studies. We also excluded simulation studies because the trade-offs involved in using larger versus smaller samples in such studies are trivial in most cases. The database and codes are available online as supplemental material at http://osf.io/7im3n .  We used the following rules to deal with non-prototypical studies: For twin studies, we used the number of twin pairs as the unit of analysis. For studies of couples, families, dyads, other groups, we used as the unit of analysis whichever unit of analysis the authors focused upon. In cases where there were multiple samples in a study, we separately recorded the sample size of each sample if those samples were analyzed separately; if they were analyzed together, we recorded instead the aggregate sample size. In studies on accuracy or ratings of targets, we treated the number of targets as the sample size of interest. In longitudinal studies we recorded the number of cases at the initial wave as the sample size; if, however, the analyses critically depended on at least two waves (e.g., the analysis of difference scores), we recorded the number of cases available at both waves. As a general rule of thumb, we used the number of cases initially sampled, even if cases were excluded for various reasons (e.g., malfunctioning equipment, failure to follow instructions). We made exceptions when the initial sample was a broad sweep (e.g., mass testing sessions in Introductory Psychology) to identify participants who met the study criteria.  We elected to code studies from PS because it is a premier journal for research in social and personality psychology. However, it is also a journal that cuts across subfields of psychology more broadly, also publishing research on visual cognition, neuroscience, and developmental psychology, for example. Therefore, we focused on PS studies that fell within the traditional purview of social/personality psychology. We classified studies as being relevant to social and personality psychology if they were explicitly concerned with topics commonly studied in these fields (e.g., stereotyping, individual differences, emotion and affect regulation, social cognition, interpersonal relationships).  Table 2 summarizes the NFs for the journals we studied, organized by year and journal. One of the first things to note is that the unweighted average of the NFs (i.e., the overall median sample size) is 104. Another thing to note is that, although some journals exhibit minor year-to-year variability in their NFs, for the most part, there is not a strong tendency for journals to be generally increasing or decreasing in the sample sizes of the studies they publish. A linear model suggests that the typical sample size across all six journals is increasing by, at best, about 1.2 cases per year. To put these numbers in historical context, it is helpful to consider some data reported by Reis and Stiller [32] . They coded the sample sizes of studies published in the 1968, 1978, and 1988 volumes of JPSP . To deal with skewness in sample sizes, they coded all studies with sample sizes greater than 999 as 999. Using this coding system, they found that the mean sample size of studies published in each of those years was 141, 158, and 200, respectively. When we used the same coding system with our data, we found that the mean sample size for JPSP across the years 2006 to 2010 was 140. These data seem to suggest that, although there was an upward trend for JPSP studies to use larger sample sizes from 1968 to 1988, that trend has apparently reversed. It seems reasonable to conclude, based on these data, that there has not been a trend for researchers or journals in social/personality psychology to be more attentive to sample size and statistical power.  10.1371/journal.pone.0109019.t002 Table 2  Median Sample Sizes for each Six Empirical Journals in Social/Personality Psychology.

JP  =  Journal of Personality, JRP  =  Journal of Research in Personality, PSPB  =  Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, JPSP  =  Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, JESP  =  Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, PS  =  Psychological Science (social/personality articles only).  One of the important features of these data is the variation among journals in the sample sizes used in published reports. For example, a typical study published in JESP in 2010 had a sample size of 98, whereas a typical study published in JP in 2010 had a sample size of 173. Indeed, the relative ranking of the six journals we studied was highly stable across years (see the top portion of Table 3 ). In other words, journals that tended to have higher NFs than other journals in one year also tended to have higher NFs than other journals in other years. This was true despite the fact that (a) the actual studies published in the journals—as well as the researchers who conducted those studies—varied from one year to the next and (b) the journals, during the time span studied, had no explicit policies concerning the minimum sample sizes required for research they publish.  10.1371/journal.pone.0109019.t003 Table 3  Correlations Among 1-year N-pact Factors, 5-year N-pact Factors, and Citation Impact Factors across the Six Journals Studied.       2006  2007  2008  2009  2010  NF-5      2006  1.00         2007  .61  1.00        2008  .55  .79  1.00       2009  .78  .95  .88  1.00      2010  .75  .87  .94  .96  1.00     NF-5  .82  .91  .90  .99  .98  1.00    IF  −.46  −.25  −.57  −.40  −.49  −.48     Note. The upper matrix represents the stability of rank ordering of journal's 1-year N-pact Factors (NFs) from 2006–2010. The lower rows represent the correlations among NFs in any one year and the NF-5 and the citation Impact Factors (IF) of journals.  Given that there are stable differences across journals in their NFs, we created a composite index—the 5-year N-pact Factor (NF-5)—to capture the average sample size for each journal across the 5-year span studied. This index was derived simply by averaging the annual NFs for each journal over the 5-year span we sampled; we did not weight any one year more highly than another. As shown in Table 3 , the NF-5 scores are strongly correlated with the yearly level NFs (.82> r s>.99). Moreover, JP has the highest NF-5 (178) whereas PS has the lowest (73). We focus our remaining analyses on the NF-5.   What is the Statistical Power of the Typical Study to Detect a Typical Effect Size?  Previously we argued that sample size is a valuable metric against which to evaluate journals because it is one of the critical ingredients in statistical power. And, importantly, statistical power is necessary for (a) being able to detect real effects accurately, (b) buffering against high false positive rates in the empirical literature, and (c) producing replicable findings. Given the importance of highly powered research for the integrity of psychological science, we next examined the statistical power of studies typically published in these journals.  Statistical power is a function of three ingredients: α, N , and the population effect size [23] . Because alpha is set to .05, by convention, we can estimate the statistical power for a typical study published in each journal using the typical N s (i.e., the NF-5) reported in Table 2 and assuming a variety of population effect sizes. Table 4 reports the estimated statistical power of the typical study published in each journal for population effect sizes corresponding to r  = .10 ( d  = .20), r  = .20 ( d  = .41), r  = .30 ( d  = .63), r  = .40 ( d  = .87), and r  = .50 ( d  = 1.15), respectively.  10.1371/journal.pone.0109019.t004 Table 4  Statistical Power to Detect Various Population Effect Sizes across Journals.

JP  =  Journal of Personality, JRP  =  Journal of Research in Personality, PSPB  =  Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, JPSP  =  Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, JESP  =  Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, PS  =  Psychological Science (social/personality articles only), JPSP:ASC  =  Attitudes and Social Cognition section of JPSP, JPSP:IRGP  =  Interpersonal Relations and Group Processes section of JPSP, JPSP:PPID  =  Personality Processes and Individual Differences section of JPSP. Power values assume a two-tailed test with an alpha level of .05.  For the sake of discussion, we focus on the results for r  = .20 ( d  = .41). We focus on this effect in particular because the Richard et al. [29] meta-analysis found that the typical effect size in social/personality psychology is r  = .21 ( d  = .43). We recognize, however, that the decision to focus on the power to detect the average effect in social/personality rather than specific effects documented in each empirical report is potentially controversial. We will return to this issue in the Discussion. But, for now, we note that the alternative to this approach is to estimate the power of studies in a post hoc way by computing the effect sizes observed in each study and, using that information and the study's sample size, compute the power of the study to detect the effect that was found. This post hoc or “observed” approach to computing power has been criticized by methodologists because observed effect sizes and sample sizes tend to be strongly negatively correlated in research literatures [33] , [34] . As a result, small- N studies that actually produce significant results tend to report larger effect sizes than comparable large- N studies, thereby biasing their observed power estimates upwards [34] .  Our focus on the power of studies to detect effects of r  = .20 helps to solve this problem because, in most research contexts, researchers do not have a precise expectation concerning the size of the effect. In such situations, the average effect size observed in a field (via meta-analysis) is a helpful way to ground those expectations [35] . Moreover, because we are focusing on averages and expectations rather than any one study in particular, it is reasonable to inquire about the statistical power of a typical study in a journal to detect a typical effect. Such an analysis is informative about the norms for the journals in question. In short, by focusing on a specific effect size ( r  = .20), we are attempting to answer a relatively basic, yet important, question: “What is the power of the typical study in each of these journals to detect the average effect reported in social-personality psychology?”  Table 4 reveals that the typical study published in the social/personality journals we examined does not have adequate power to detect an effect equivalent to a correlation of .20. For example, JPSP , PSPB , and JESP each have close to or less than a 50-50 chance of correctly detecting population effects equivalent to a correlation of .20. This implies that, if, in fact, the null hypothesis is false and the population effect is equivalent to a Pearson correlation of .20, the typical study published in these journals is not any better able to detect that effect than a “test” based on tossing a coin. JP and JRP are exceptions to this trend. The typical study in JRP , for example, performed better than a coin flip (63% power) and the typical study published in JP approached what Cohen [23] considered an adequate degree of power (i.e., 80%), given the various tradeoffs involved in collecting psychological/behavioral data. The relative rankings of the journals with respect to the statistical power to detect a correlation of .20 are illustrated in Figure 1 .  10.1371/journal.pone.0109019.g001 Figure 1  Rankings of Journals in Social-Personality Psychology with Respect to their Statistical Power.  JP  =  Journal of Personality, JRP  =  Journal of Research in Personality, PSPB  =  Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, JPSP  =  Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, JESP  =  Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, PS  =  Psychological Science (social/personality articles only). The hashed line represents the statistical power (80%) recommended by Cohen (1992).   Given that the two journals explicitly focused on personality processes and individual differences ( JP and JRP ) had more power than the other journals, we decided to further explore potential subfield differences by separately examining studies published in the three sections of JPSP : Attitudes and Social Cognition (ASC), Interpersonal Relations and Group Processes (IRGP), and Personality Processes and Individual Differences (PPID). Averaging across years, the median sample size of studies published in these three sections was 79, 94.7, and 122, respectively. This corresponds to power values of .43, .49, and .60, respectively, to detect a population effect size of r  = .20. Thus, there appears to be a tendency for research on personality and individual differences to utilize larger samples than research in social psychology and, accordingly, to have greater statistical power to detect the average effect sizes reported in social/personality psychology.   What are the Estimated False Positive Rates of Findings Published in Journals?  Recall that most journals in psychology tend to publish articles for which the key findings were statistically significant [12] . Thus, with respect to Table 1 , published articles are either false positives (Type I errors or rejections of the null hypothesis when it is, in fact, true) or Correct Hits (i.e., rejections of the null hypothesis when it is, in fact, false). The overall false positive rate in a literature can be defined as the number of false positives relative to the total number of significant effects (i.e., B/(B+D)), weighted by the relative a priori likelihood of null hypotheses being true or false in a research literature [10] , [13] (see Table 1 ).  Table 5 explores the false positive rate estimated for various journals in social/personality psychology as a function of their power to detect an effect size equal to a Pearson correlation of .20. Because there is no way of knowing with certitude the a priori likelihood of the null hypothesis being true in various research literatures (i.e., P (H 0 )), for illustrative purposes we report false positive rate estimates under values of P (H 0 ) of .50 and .80. A value of .50 corresponds to situations in which researchers are investigating hypotheses that, a priori , are just as likely to be true as they are to be false. This might be the case in situations in which the focal hypothesis predicts that Group A will score higher than Group B, but a credible alternative hypothesis predicts no effect or an effect in the opposite direction. According to our calculations, the false positive rate for journals in this scenario range between 6% and 11%. Among the higher power journals, such as JP , the false positive rate is close to the nominal alpha rate of 5%. The estimated false positive rate (11%) is more than twice the nominal alpha rate for PS under these assumptions.  10.1371/journal.pone.0109019.t005 Table 5  Estimated False Positive Rates of Findings Published across Journals, Assuming no Questionable Research Practices.       P (H 0 )  =  true       .50  .80    JP  .06  .21    JRP  .07  .24    PSPB  .09  .29    JPSP  .09  .29    JESP  .10  .30    PS  .11  .33    JPSP:ASC  .10  .32    JPSP:IRGP  .09  .29    JPSP:PPID  .08  .25     Note . P (H 0 )  =  the a priori probability that the null hypothesis is true in a given research area. JP  =  Journal of Personality, JRP  =  Journal of Research in Personality, PSPB  =  Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, JPSP  =  Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, JESP  =  Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, PS  =  Psychological Science (social/personality articles only), JPSP:ASC  =  Attitudes and Social Cognition section of JPSP, JPSP:IRGP  =  Interpersonal Relations and Group Processes section of JPSP, JPSP:PPID  =  Personality Processes and Individual Differences section of JPSP.  Table 5 also illustrates estimated false positive rates for each journal under the assumption that there is an 80% likelihood of the null hypothesis being correct, a priori . This assumption might characterize research areas in which investigators are testing risky or counter-intuitive hypotheses about how subtle experimental manipulations affect complex forms of behavior or areas of research in which there are multiple potential moderators of hypothesized effects, each of which has the potential to qualify or mask the focal effect being investigated. The estimated false positive rate under these circumstances is close to 28%. Indeed, according to our calculations, one in every three findings published in PS could be a false positive under these assumptions.  It is important to note that these estimates assume that researchers are not engaging in so-called questionable research practices , such as analyzing the data before the study is complete, selectively dropping dependent measures that “didn't work” but which would have been included if they had, etc. [36] . As Simmons and his colleagues note [36] , such practices will inflate the false positive rate considerably. A survey by John, Loewenstein, and Prelec [37] revealed that questionable research practices are used with some degree of frequency in psychological research. If that is correct, then the numbers reported in Table 5 will underestimate the false positive rates of these journals considerably. The numbers we have reported are based exclusively on what is known about the average power of studies reported in these journals to detect typical effect sizes and reflect what the false positive rates would be if researchers did not engage in any questionable research practices.   Do Journals with High Citation Impact Factors Publish Research with Higher N-Pact Factors?  Figure 2 illustrates the bivariate association between the 2011 Impact Factors of the journals we studied and their 5-year N-pact Factors. The figure reveals that the higher impact journals in social/personality psychology are not necessarily more likely to be publishing research based on high N , high power designs. In fact, the association between the NP and the 2011 IF is negative for every year sampled (see the lower row of Table 3 ). In other words, the journals that have the highest impact also tend to publish studies that have smaller samples.  10.1371/journal.pone.0109019.g002 Figure 2  Journals plotted in a two-dimensional space defined by their 5-year N-Pact Factors (NF-5) and their citation Impact Factors.   Following suggestions from a reviewer, we also examined two alternative impact metrics, the eigenfactor (EF) and article influence (AI). The EF is a measure of a journal's “total importance to the scientific community”; the AI is a measure of the average influence of each of a journal's articles over the first five years after publication (see eigenfactor.org). Despite being based on different sources of information, these two metrics were highly correlated with one another among the 6 journals studied here ( r  = .96). Moreover, each was highly correlated with the Thompson Reuters Impact Factor ( r  = .94 and .98, respectively). They both correlated negatively with the NF-5: r s = −.68 and −.53, respectively.   Discussion  The purpose of this article is to propose that one valuable way to conceptualize the “quality” of empirical studies and the journals that publish them is with respect to statistical power. Statistical power is critical for high quality research because studies that have higher power designs are more likely than those that do not to (a) produce precise estimates, (b) produce literatures with lower overall false positive rates; and (c) produce the kinds of replicable findings needed for a cumulative science. We have argued that journals that have a tendency to publish higher power studies should be held in higher regard than journals that publish lower powered studies—a quality we indexed using the N-pact Factor.  We used the NF to index the quality of research published in six well regarded journals in social and personality psychology (see Table 2 ). According to our analysis, the typical sample size used in studies published in our premier journals was 104. Some journals, however, tended to publish studies that substantially exceeded this value. The Journal of Personality , for example, had a NF-5 of 178 over the time span sampled here (i.e., 2006–2010). This indicates that the typical study published in the Journal of Personality has close to an 80% power to detect effects equal to a Pearson correlation of .20. The journal that we studied that had the lowest NF over the time span was Psychological Science . The typical social-personality study published in PS had 40% power to detect a correlation of .20.  For the most part, the relative ranking of the six journals we sampled was constant over the 5-year span, although some journals exhibited more year-to-year variability than others. There was not a general tendency for journals to increase in the typical sample size of the studies they published over time. We found that, in research areas where researchers might be testing risky or counter-intuitive hypotheses, the false positive rate could be as high as 25%. That is, one in every four published findings could be a Type I error. This estimate is a lower bound because it assumes that researchers are not engaging in questionable research practices. If they are (see John et al., 2011), then the false positive rate will substantially exceed 25%. We also found that journals which emphasized social psychology over personality psychology tended to have lower NFs. This was most clearly illustrated in considering the three sections of JPSP . The overall NF for the Attitudes and Social Cognition section was 79, whereas the overall NF for the Individual Differences and Personality Processes section was 122. This was the case even though previous meta-analyses indicate that the typical effect sizes examined in these subdisciplines are comparable [29] .   What about Research that is Naturally Focused on Larger Effect Sizes?  In this article we have focused on the statistical power of studies published in social/personality psychology to detect an effect equivalent to a Pearson correlation of .20. One potential concern with this decision is that certain areas of research might naturally require smaller sample sizes than others because they investigate population effect sizes that are substantially larger than r  = .20. Although it does seem likely to us that some effects that psychologists study are larger than others and might require smaller sample sizes to accurately detect, we caution against this line of thinking for the purposes of evaluating the research quality of journals in social/personality psychology for two reasons.  First, as discussed previously, there is little reason to believe that effect sizes vary systematically across various journals in social/personality psychology. The journals we sampled publish research that spans a broad spectrum of topics in this discipline. And, to the extent that there are potential differences across journals with respect to content or methods, that line is probably best drawn between social psychology and personality psychology. But, as we noted previously, the meta-analysis by Richard et al. [29] found that most effect size estimates from research focused on situational factors and that focused on person factors are comparable. Such findings suggest that, although research in social and personality psychology may differ in a number of ways [28] , the size of the effects upon which they focus is not one of them.  Second, although some researchers believe that the effects they are investigating are likely to be larger than r  = .20, researcher's intuitions are often based on studies that “worked” rather than studies that did not. As a result, researchers' intuitions about the effect sizes in their areas are likely to be overestimates of the actual effects. When researchers toil in small- N fields for too long, they become accustomed to seeing large effect sizes because the only studies that can “work” in such situations are the ones that produce effect size estimates that are large enough to cross the p <.05 hurdle. This can happen, of course, if the actual effect sizes are large, but it can also happen incidentally by capitalizing on the sampling variation inherent in small- N studies [18] . Indeed, it is well known that effect size estimates are biased upwards in small-sample studies [34] . This bias can lead researcher's expectations for what a “typical” effect size is to be unrealistically large. As an analogy, if a person were to wear blinders that only allowed him to see objects that were at least 6 ft. tall, that person would likely grossly overestimate the average height of people in the population.  Third, with few exceptions, most hypotheses in social/personality psychology are framed as directional rather than quantitative predictions. For example, researchers might predict that, in light of certain theoretical considerations, Group 1 should have a higher mean on a certain outcome variable than Group 2, an interaction term should be greater than zero, or a correlation should be negative. It is rarely the case that a theory predicts something as precise as a .50 SD difference between groups, for example. Given that most predictions tested in psychology are of a directional variety where any non-zero effect in a specific direction would be taken as being consistent with the theory , it is reasonable to ask whether the typical study is capable of detecting relatively small, theory-consistent effects.  We think this suggestion is especially pertinent in light of recent debates about the robustness of well-known and highly publicized priming studies in social psychology. Based on the original publications of some of these controversial findings, it would seem that these effects are substantial—with effect sizes comparable to Cohen d s of .50 to 1.00 (i.e., Pearson correlations ranging from .24 to .45)(see [38] ). Subsequent researchers, however, have had a difficult time replicating these effects (e.g., [39] , [40] ). Although some scholars have billed these failures to replicate as justification for questioning the whether these effects are “real,” a plausible alternative is that the actual effect sizes are much smaller than what has been previously assumed (see [41] for a discussion of this point). Our goal here is not to take a stance on this specific debate, but to call attention to two points. Namely, well-known and seemingly powerful findings in social/personality psychology may not have large effect sizes even if the canonical demonstrations of those findings reported large effect sizes (see [42] ). Second, the debate over the existence of such effects might be more reasonably resolved if investigators calibrated their research designs against the expectation that, if specific effects are possible in certain experimental contexts, the effects are more likely to be small than large in size.   Are High Power Studies Always Better?  Some researchers have expressed the concern that large sample sizes are a double edged sword. This apprehension stems from the fact that it is possible to obtain statistically significant results for even extremely small effects when sample sizes are large (see [43] ). Although we agree that it is easier to detect small effects in large- N research (i.e., when power is high), we do not believe that this is a weakness of large sample research. In our view, this so-called problem is a limitation with theory testing in many areas of psychology. Meehl [44] noted decades ago that, when sample sizes are large in social science, the probability of empirically corroborating a directional prediction that has no validity whatsoever approaches 50%. Thus, finding empirical support for a typical prediction in psychological science is trivially easy once the problems of sampling error are eliminated. Meehl's point was not that statistical power makes hypothesis testing too easy; his point was that, if hypothesis testing seems too easy in highly powered situations, then that is a reflection of the imprecision of the hypothesis being tested. The solution is not to make the hurdle more challenging by using low-powered designs. The solution is to develop theories that make riskier (i.e., quantitatively more precise) predictions [45] .  We appreciate the fact that many researchers have a disinterest in effect sizes below a certain threshold (e.g., −.10< r <.10) for practical reasons rather than theoretical ones. For example, if researchers are interested in how specific interventions might affect intergroup behavior, there may be a point at which the cost of the intervention exceeds the practical gains to be had. In such circumstances, researchers should make these thresholds clear a priori and design studies that are powerful enough to detect effects above the threshold at which they are invested [17] . For example, if researchers are only interested in effect sizes that are equivalent to correlations of .10 or larger, then they need sample sizes of at least 617 to have 80% power to detect the lower bound of this range. (We should be clear in noting that these thresholds should not be chosen on arbitrary grounds. Many researchers dismiss “small effects” without having a proper appreciation for just how theoretically and practically meaningful a so-called “small” effect can be [46] , [47] .) Furthermore, if researchers conduct a high-powered study and obtain a significant but too-small-to-be-interesting effect, they can identify it as practically unimportant and interpret it as such. Large samples in no way force researchers to interpret small effects as meaningful if they chose to discount effects within a certain range. To the contrary, large samples give researchers the level of precision necessary to determine whether an effect is practically meaningful.  One problem, however, is that not all research in psychology has obvious practical relevance. As Mook [48] famously noted in his defense of external invalidity, sometimes the point of research is simply to demonstrate that something is possible, under the right circumstances. In such situations, the magnitude of the effect may be less relevant for theory appraisal than, say, the question of whether the effect is in one direction vs. another. When this is the case, it is particularly important that researchers use highly powered designs because they need to insure that the design is actually capable of detecting an effect in the predicted direction, even if it is small. Without any constraints on what size effects would be practically meaningful, both small and large effects are relevant for hypothesis testing. Indeed, it has long been argued that small effects can be theoretically meaningful (e.g., [49] ); thus, the integrity of research in basic science (i.e., research designed to test theoretical mechanisms rather than applications per se) hinges crucially on the ability of that research to detect small, theoretically consistent effects. Even if researchers consider the actual effect sizes to be somewhat arbitrary due to the vicissitudes of the way variables are manipulated and measured, estimating those effects well is necessary for building knowledge (e.g., reconciling contradictory findings), accurately testing theories, replicating and extending research, protecting the literature against false positives, and discovering the actual boundary conditions of certain effects.   Limitations  The most important limitation of the NF is that no single metric can capture all important aspects of journal quality. No journal, and of course no researcher or body of research, should be judged solely on one aspect of research design. This is true of the IF and also of the NF. We do not intend for the NF to be the only index of journal quality. Rather, we believe that the NF complements the IF, and tracks some especially important components of research quality (i.e., precision, accuracy, and reliability)—components that are vital for good science, yet grossly undervalued in many areas of psychological science.  Another limitation of the NF is that, as it is currently quantified, it does not distinguish between within-subjects and between-subjects designs. Because the same total sample size provides much more statistical power for within- compared to between-subjects or mixed designs, our analyses underestimate the NF of journals that publish a higher proportion of purely within-subjects studies. However, our present analyses focus on research in social and personality psychology, and the primary question of interest in most social and personality research involves comparisons between people—people who vary in dispositional or attitudinal factors, people who differ in culture, and people assigned to different levels of experimental conditions. Nevertheless, before applying the NF to other subdisciplines (e.g., memory, visual cognition), it is important to calculate power appropriately for each type of design. Ultimately, this may require that the NF only be used to compare journals within specific fields (e.g., journals with social/personality psychology, journals within cognitive neuroscience) rather than across fields. That is, it is most defensible to use the NF to compare two journals in social psychology against one another than to compare a journal in social psychology with a journal in visual cognition.  Finally, we have discussed the value of sample size within a NHST framework. We have used this framework because the vast majority of psychologists use NHST as means of analyzing data and testing theories. We agree with critics of NHST, however, who have argued that not only is NHST a poor framework for theory testing (e.g., [45] ), it has little to add above and beyond parameter estimation approaches. In parameter estimation approaches (e.g., [50] ) the goal of research is to estimate parameters of interest, whether those are differences between conditions, patterns of means, or correlations. Indeed, once one begins thinking in terms of parameter estimation, the concept of statistical power becomes irrelevant [17] . Importantly, sample size is crucial in both NHST and parameter estimation approaches to empirical science and, as such, the N -pact Factor is a valuable way to rank journals regardless of one's preference. In an effect estimation paradigm, researchers will want to consider how precise they want their estimates to be. In early studies, for example, researchers might be more concerned with ballpark estimates and less concerned with getting the estimate exactly right. In situations where theory testing involves being able to rule out quantitatively similar predictions, however, getting tighter estimates has enormous value. An emphasis on effect sizes and precision of estimates is preferable to the dichotomous thinking of NHST for many reasons, perhaps most importantly because it encourages meta-analytic thinking–every finding is just more grist for the mill, and the larger your sample size the more grist you are contributing to the meta-analytic mill. We believe that the NF is useful whether one adopts the NHST framework, the parameter estimation framework, or even a Bayseian framework.   Goals, Recommendations, and Future Directions  One of our goals is to encourage journals (and their editors, publishers, and societies that sponsor them) to pay attention to and strive to improve their NFs. By highlighting the role of sample size and power in high quality research and ranking journals with respect to their N -pact Factors, we hope to create reputational incentives for journals to increase their NF scores over the years. Another goal of our efforts is to provide people with an additional heuristic to use when deciding which journal to submit to, what to read, what to believe, or where to look to find studies to publicize.  One potentially useful future extension of the N -pact Factor is to consider the typical sample size or statistical power used by a given researcher. It is not uncommon for promotion committees, for example, to ask questions about the citation rates and impact of an individual researcher, as quantified, for example, with the h -index (where h is defined as the maximum number of papers a researcher has that have been cited at least h times). Like journal impact factors, such metrics emphasize something important that might not reflect the quality of the research itself. However, something that does (e.g., something based on sample sizes, power, or precision) could prove to be a valuable way to supplement traditional evaluations of the work that a researcher produces.  We close by noting that the goal of improving power and sample sizes in empirical studies in psychology is potentially in tension with other laudable goals. For example, multi-method designs, longitudinal designs, and ecologically valid designs are necessary for addressing many of the challenging questions in the field, but they are harder to implement using larger versus smaller sample sizes. Therefore, as researchers and journals aim to increase their power, they should also make sure to balance this goal with the goal of using rigorous methods and, when relevant, producing externally valid results. It would be lamentable if, in the pursuit of large sample sizes, journals began to publish a disproportionate number of studies based on Amazon Mechanical Turk workers or vignette studies of Introduction to Psychology students. These studies have their place, of course, but our preference would be for people to use whatever methods they believe are appropriate for the research question at hand and simply scale up the sample size in a way that increases the precision of the research.  Can we have it all? In short, no. It would be difficult for researchers in our field to continue publishing at current rates while also increasing their power. Something has to give. Like other people in our field (e.g., [51] ), we believe that what has to give is the excessive rate of publication that has become the norm in social and personality psychology. As anyone on a hiring, award, or promotion committee lately has surely noticed, the expectations for number of publications have increased to the point where the most productive members of our field are publishing 20 or more articles per year. Some of this is due to increased collaboration, which is a positive development, but some of it is in response to the pressures and incentives in our field, which currently focus almost exclusively on quantity, often at the expense of quality. We hope that introducing the NF will help counteract this trend and create an incentive for journals, and therefore researchers, to value the ability of research to produce precise, accurate, and replicable research.  A “slow research movement” [51] would be a useful development for many reasons. First, rather than diluting their resources (e.g., running 10 studies with N  = 50 each), researchers could focus their limited resources on one or two well-powered studies (e.g., running 2 studies with N  = 250 each), which would provide more precise effect estimates and more robust knowledge. Second, a greater proportion of our published findings would be replicable. Third, if we all ran fewer but larger studies and published fewer but more informative papers, this would also help avert another impending crisis: the shortage of editors and reviewers to handle all of the manuscripts coming in (not to mention the shortage of readers to read the published articles).   Summary  How should we gauge the quality of research journals in psychology? In this article we have argued that the average statistical power of studies published by journals provides one useful way of quantifying the quality of research published in those journals. All things being equal, studies based on large sample sizes are more likely to detect true effects, limit the number of false positive rates in the research literature, and produce replicable findings. Our analyses indicate that the N-pact Factor is a useful way of ranking well-regarded journals in social/personality psychology. It is our hope to continue ranking journals with respect to the NF in the years to come in order to incentivize competition among journals on something other than their impact factors alone.

Intensity and duration are two central characteristics of an emotional response. Appraisals and regulation strategies are among the most important determinants of these emotion features. However, as intensity and duration are only moderately correlated, appraisals and regulation strategies may be differently related to these characteristics. A systematic empirical study comparing predictors of emotion intensity and duration is missing. The goal of the present study is to fill this gap. Participants were asked to recall recently experienced episodes of anger, fear, disgust, guilt, sadness, and shame. Subsequently, they were asked to answer a number of questions regarding (a) the intensity and duration of these emotions, (b) their appraisal of the emotion-eliciting event, and (c) their use of a wide range of regulation strategies. Emotion intensity was found to be mainly predicted by appraisals whereas emotion duration was equally well predicted by appraisals and regulation strategies.

During the first stage the emotion blossoms and strengthens over time, adding to the overall intensity of the emotion. During the second stage the emotion fades with the speed of this recovery process being strongly related to the duration of the emotion.  Intensity and duration are two salient features of an emotional response [3] . Indeed, when people talk about their emotions, they often not only describe the nature of the emotion but also the intensity or duration (e.g., I was very angry, I felt sad all day long ). The study of emotion intensity and duration is not only important to get a better understanding of the emotional life of normal individuals but it is also of high importance in clinical settings as emotional disturbances are often characterized by inappropriately strong (or weak) and long (or short) emotions [4] .  Emotions display a remarkable variability in intensity and duration [5] – [8] . Consequently, one may wonder which determinants account for this variability. In the next two sections, we will discuss research on the two major classes of predictors of emotion intensity and duration, namely appraisals and emotion-regulation strategies.   Predictors of Emotion Intensity  Frijda and colleagues [9] argued that appraisals and emotion-regulation strategies are the most important predictors of emotion intensity. Appraisals refer to evaluations of the emotion-eliciting event. Several different appraisal dimensions have been proposed (for a comparative overview, see [10] ), many of them entailing a comparison between an event and a desired state. For example, an appraisal of goal congruency implies a check of whether an event is conducive to reaching one’s goals. A central hypothesis within appraisal theory is that, when an event is appraised to create a mismatch between the current state and a desired one, a negative emotion follows. Moreover, the stronger this mismatch, the more intense the ensuing negative emotion will be [11] – [12] . This hypothesis has been supported by a number of studies [9] , [13] .  Emotion regulation has been defined as the strategies people use to influence which emotions they have, when they have them, and how they experience and express them [14] . The relation between emotion and regulation strategies is complex as, on the one hand, emotion intensity determines the required amount of regulation and, on the other hand, regulation will influence emotion intensity [9] . Regarding the former, high emotional intensity has been found to initiate an increased use of regulation strategies regardless of the nature of the strategy [15] . Regarding the latter, it has been shown that some strategies (e.g., rumination) increase emotion intensity whereas others (e.g., reappraisal) dampen it [14] , [16] .  In most studies on determinants of emotion intensity, appraisals and regulation strategies were investigated separately. Consequently, it remains largely unclear which class of predictors explains most variability in emotion intensity. A notable exception is a study by Sonnemans & Frijda [9] in which it was found that appraisals were more predictive of emotion intensity than regulation strategies. This relatively low predictive power of regulation strategies may, however, be partly due to the way emotion regulation was assessed. Specifically, for each recalled emotion episode, participants were asked to indicate to what extent they had tried to dampen their emotional feelings, behavior, and expression. As such, regulatory effort was measured but the nature of the particular regulation strategy that was deployed was not taken into account. This is troublesome as the relationship between emotion regulation and emotion intensity depends on the nature of the regulation strategy in question [14] . Consequently it remains to be seen whether appraisals still explain more variance in intensity than regulation when the latter is measured in a more differentiated fashion.   Determinants of Emotion Duration  For a long time research on emotion duration was rather scarce. However, during the last two decades several attempts have been made to contribute solid evidence regarding predictors of emotion duration. In a recent paper, Van Mechelen, Verduyn, & Brans [17] reviewed determinants of duration and concluded that, similarly to intensity, appraisals and emotion-regulation strategies are among the most important predictors of emotion duration.  The relation between appraisals and emotion duration has been empirically demonstrated in a number of recent studies. In particular, Verduyn et al. [6] found that perceived event importance is positively related to emotion duration. Furthermore, it has been shown that negative emotions last especially long when the eliciting event and its consequences are perceived to be incongruent with the individual’s goals, values, and self-ideal, creating a mismatch [18] .  The relation between several types of emotion-regulation strategies and emotion duration has also been studied ( [6] , [19] ). In these studies rumination has been found to sustain emotions [6] , [16] whereas reappraisal and distraction shorten emotion duration [19] .  However, similarly to emotion intensity, these determinant classes were typically not studied simultaneously. Consequently, the relative predictive power of the different classes of predictors is unclear. Importantly, as intensity and duration have been found to correlate only moderately [5] , [18] , [20] it cannot be taken for granted that the predictive power of the different classes of determinants is similar for duration and intensity. A systematic empirical study is needed to directly compare the degree to which appraisals and regulation strategies are predictive of emotion intensity and of duration.   The Present Study  The overall aim of the present study is to systematically investigate appraisals and regulation strategies as predictors of the intensity and the duration of negative emotions. This will contribute to a better understanding of the factors underlying variability in emotion intensity and duration. Regarding appraisals, dimensions were selected from the Geneva Appraisal Questionnaire [21] : Importance and disadvantageousness of the emotion-eliciting event, other and own responsibility, problem- and emotion-focused coping, expectedness, impact of the event on the self-image, and, injustice and immorality of the event. With regard to emotion-regulation strategies, five commonly used strategies were investigated: Reappraisal, rumination, reflection, distraction, and expressive suppression. Regarding emotions, six commonly experienced negative emotions were selected [22] : Anger, disgust, fear, guilt, sadness, and shame.  Within our overall aim, we distinguish three subgoals with associated hypotheses: First, we aimed to verify whether appraisals and emotion-regulation strategies are indeed important predictors of emotion intensity and duration. In this regard, we hypothesized that each class of predictors would account for a substantial part of variability in emotion intensity and duration.  Second, because of the rather small correlation between intensity and duration, we aimed to investigate whether determinant classes are differentially related to emotion intensity and duration. Our hypotheses (for a graphical representation, see Figure 1 ) result from the timing of the two central stages of an emotional episode: emotion blossoming (stage 1 associated with emotion intensity) and emotion fading (stage 2 associated with emotion duration). As appraisal processes already start taking place from the onset of the emotional episode, we expect that they will be especially predictive of the blossoming process and associated emotion intensity. This hypothesis is consistent with the finding of Sonnemans & Frijda [5] that appraisals are highly predictive of emotion intensity. In contrast, emotion regulation comes especially into play later on in the episode, determining the steepness with which the emotional response returns to a neutral baseline [2] , [23] . Consequently, regulation can be expected to be especially related to features reflecting emotional recovery such as emotion duration.  10.1371/journal.pone.0092410.g001 Figure 1  Graphical representation of hypothesized relationships between appraisals and regulation strategies, and the intensity and duration of emotions.  Thick and thin lines represent strong and weak connections, respectively.   Even though appraisals are expected to be the main predictor of emotion intensity, we expect them to be related to emotion duration to some degree as well as certain appraisal configurations may slow down the recovery process. For example, event importance has been found to be predictive of emotion duration even when controlling for emotion intensity [6] , [18] and low coping potential has been found to be associated with a prolongation of emotional recovery [24] . Similarly, we expect regulation strategies to be mainly predictive of emotion duration but also to some degree of emotion intensity. Emotion blossoming is not necessarily restricted to the period immediately following the emotion-eliciting event but may take some time [7] during which regulation strategies may stimulate (or hamper) the blossoming process, which in turn affects emotion intensity. For example, rumination has been found to intensify the emotional response following an emotion induction [25] .  Third, we aimed to investigate how specific appraisals and regulation strategies are related to emotion intensity and duration. Regarding appraisals, we hypothesized that the more an event would be perceived as important and as creating a mismatch, the more intense and longer lasting the negative emotion would be [11] , [12] , [18] . Specifically, we expected importance and disadvantageousness of the event, impact of the event on the self-image, injustice and immorality of the event to be positively related to negative emotion intensity and duration, whereas emotion- and problem focused coping would be negatively related. Furthermore, as own and other responsibility do no not directly express a mismatch, they were hypothesized not to be related to negative emotion intensity and duration. Finally, in line with previous findings [9] , [18] we hypothesized expectedness not to be related to negative emotion intensity and duration. With regard to regulation, we hypothesized that rumination and expressive suppression would be positively related to negative emotion intensity and duration [26] , [27] whereas reflection, reappraisal and distraction would be negatively related to it ( [14] , [28] , [29] .  To test these hypotheses, participants were asked to recall recently experienced episodes of anger, fear, disgust, guilt, sadness, and shame. Subsequently, they were asked to answer a number of questions regarding (a) the intensity and duration of these emotions; (b) their appraisal of the emotion-eliciting event; and (c) their use of a wide range of emotion-regulation strategies.   Methods   Ethics Statement  The study was conducted in April 2011 as part of a large collective research program organized and approved by the Faculty of Psychology and Educational Sciences, KU Leuven, Belgium. All first year psychology students are invited to participate in this research in exchange for course credits. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants at the start of the program.  In accordance with the “Law of 7 May 2004 concerning experiments on the human person” an authorization is necessary from the Medical Ethics Committee of the University Hospitals Leuven, Faculty of Medicine for experiments that “touch the person in their essence.” These experiments mean studies which include physical changes such as the need to breathe faster, painful stimuli, using deception and other (taken from https://ppw.kuleuven.be/intern/ethischecommissie/index and translated to English). In the present study, participants completed a retrospective questionnaire and consequently the study falls outsides these conditions and did not necessitate approval from the ethics committee.  However, as of June 2012, the Faculty of Psychology and Educational Sciences has decided that all studies within the collective research program would require ethical approval. Since then, we have applied for and have been granted ethical approval for studies using similar participants and similar questionnaires.  Only one of the participants (N = 408) was a legal minor (The participant was 17 at the time of the data collection). As mentioned above, informed consent was obtained from all participants at the start of the collective research program (September 2010). There was no different procedure for this participant because according to the “Law of 22 August 2002 on Patient Rights” (Art.12§2) “The rights set out in this act may be exercised independently by the minor patient who is capable to reasonably assess/judge his interests.” (Taken from http://www.ejustice.just.fgov.be/cgi_loi/change_lg.pl?language=nl&la=N&cn=2002082245&table_name=wet and translated to English). It was assumed that minors aged 17 are capable to reasonably assess their interests.   Participants  Participants were 408 first-year students of the University of Leuven with a mean age of 18.9 ( SD  = 1.32). The sample consisted of 73 men and 332 women (three participants did not report their gender). Participation was in partial fulfillment of a course requirement.   Materials  For the present study, an emotion questionnaire was designed. This questionnaire was designed in Dutch. On the first page of this questionnaire, participants were explained that they were expected to recall a number of recent emotion episodes (anger, fear, disgust, guilt, sadness, and shame) and answer a number of questions on them. Subsequently, two important conceptual clarifications were offered. First, to make sure that participants would supply information regarding emotions and not moods, they were told that an emotion is always elicited by a certain internal or external event, and thus has a clear onset point [30] . Second, to avoid different interpretations of the concept of emotion duration, participants were told that an emotion ends as soon as an emotion is no longer felt for the first time (with, if the emotion is re-experienced later on, this is to be considered a new episode). As an exception, interruptions in the emotion episode due to sleep were allowed, making it possible for an emotion episode to last longer than a day. This definition has been repeatedly used in previous research on emotion duration [4] , [6] , [19] .  The remainder of the questionnaire consisted of six two-page sections with each section corresponding to a different emotion. The order of these sections was randomized across participants. Each section started with the instruction to recall a recent episode of the emotion in question and to briefly describe the emotion-eliciting event. Subsequently, participants were asked to indicate when the emotion-eliciting event occurred (1 = a day ago, 2 = weeks ago, 3 = months ago, or 4 = years ago). Next, they were asked to rate the global intensity and the duration of the emotion episode. For intensity, they rated the overall intensity of the emotion on an 8-point Likert scale, ranging from 0 ( not intense at all ) to 7 ( very intense ). For duration, participants were asked to rate the duration of the emotion by specifying the number of days, hours, minutes and/or seconds the emotional experience had lasted.  Subsequently, the emotion-eliciting event was rated on a number of appraisal dimensions. For all the dimensions, the item started with ‘To which extent’ and was completed with, ‘was the event that elicited the emotion important to you?’ (importance); ‘was the event that elicited the emotion disadvantageous to you?’ (disadvantageousness); ‘did you think someone else was responsible for the occurrence of the event that elicited the emotion? (other responsibility)’; ‘did you ought yourself responsible for the occurrence of the event that elicited the emotion?’ (own responsibility); ‘did you think that you could change something about the event that elicited the emotion?’ (problem-focused coping); ‘did you think that you could deal with the emotions that were elicited by the event?’ (emotion-focused coping); ‘did you expect the event that elicited the emotion?’ (expectedness); ‘did the event have a negative impact on your self-image?’ (impact on self-image); ‘did you find the event that elicited the emotion unjust?’ (injustice); ‘did you think that the event that elicited the emotion was immoral?’ (immorality). All appraisal items were rated on an 8-point Likert scale ranging from 0 to 7, with 7 indicating strong agreement with the item.  Finally, participants were asked to indicate which emotion-regulation strategies they had deployed during the episode. For all five strategies under study, the item started with ‘At the time, when you experienced the emotion, to which extent did you’ and was completed with ‘ruminate about the emotion-eliciting event?’ (rumination), ‘calmly reflect on the emotion-eliciting event?’ (reflection), ‘try to see the emotion-eliciting event from a different perspective?’ (reappraisal), ‘try to suppress the expression of your emotion?’ (expressive suppression), and ‘divert your attention away from what happened?’ (distraction). Each strategy was rated on an 8-point Likert scale ranging from 0 ( not at all ) to 7 ( very much ).   Procedure  Participants were invited to the psychology department and were asked to complete several different questionnaires. In the present study we report on the emotion questionnaire that was designed to investigate predictors of emotion intensity and duration described above. At the end of the study, participants were thanked for their participation.   Results   Descriptive Statistics   Time since occurrence  In line with the instructions, the majority of the reported episodes happened recently. In particular, on average, 73% percent of the episodes were experienced the previous day or within the last couple of weeks.   Intensity and duration  Descriptive statistics for the intensity and duration are presented in Table 1 (for a graphical representation see Figure 2 ). Differences between emotions in intensity and duration were investigated by means of a Repeated Measures ANOVA. Subsequently, we examined all pair-wise comparisons (with Bonferroni correction) to get a more refined understanding of the nature of the between-emotion differences. Specific differences between emotion pairs can be read from Table 1 . Below we will only mention the emotions with the highest and the lowest ratings.  10.1371/journal.pone.0092410.g002 Figure 2  The mean intensity (top) and mean (log transformed) duration (bottom) by emotion.  10.1371/journal.pone.0092410.t001 Table 1  Descriptive Statistics (Means and Standard Deviations) for Dependent Variables: Intensity and (log transformed) Duration and the Correlations between Intensity and (log transformed) Duration.

Within rows, emotions sharing a subscript do not differ significantly. All correlations were significant at p <.001.  Evidence for variability in intensity between emotions was found ( F (4.86,1677.65) = 59.90; p <.001; partial η 2  = .15 ). It appeared that, on average, episodes of sadness were rated as most intense, and episodes of shame, guilt, and disgust were rated lowest in intensity.  Regarding duration, a highly positively skewed distribution was obtained. Therefore, to avoid that outliers (i.e., very long emotional episodes) would bias our findings, the duration ratings (in seconds) were logarithmically transformed. Evidence for variability in duration between emotions was found ( F (4.93,1569.00) = 104.79; p <.001; partial η 2  = .25). It appeared that, overall, episodes of sadness lasted the longest, and episodes of fear, shame, and disgust were the shortest.  Intensity and (the log transformed) duration variable showed small to moderate correlations. In particular, the correlation ranged from .27 (fear), up to .41 (guilt), with a median correlation of.38.   Determinants  In Table 2 , for each emotion, the means and standard deviations for the different appraisal dimensions and regulation strategies are presented. To investigate possible differences between emotions, the same data analytic strategy as for intensity and duration was used.  10.1371/journal.pone.0092410.t002 Table 2  Means and Standard Deviations for the Different Classes of Determinants.

Within rows, emotions sharing a subscript do not differ significantly.  Firstly, from Table 2 it appears that, for all appraisal dimensions, except for expectedness, there were significant differences between emotions (for importance, F (4.76, 1638.31) = 116.87; partial η 2  = .25; for disadvantageousness, F (4.89,1693.53) = 50.23; partial η 2  = .13; for other responsibility F (4.70,1626.05) = 233.23; partial η 2  = .40; for own responsibility, F (4.65,1604.45) = 298.49; partial η 2  = .46; for problem-focused coping F (4.84,1668.12) = 102.19; partial η 2  = .23; for emotion-focused coping F (4.80,1657.52) = 42.91; partial η 2  = .11; for injustice, F (4.88,1688.65) = 96.02; partial η 2  = .22; for impact on the self-image, F (4.81,1653.99) = 63.72; partial η 2  = .16; for immorality ( F (4.57,1554.85) = 30.76; partial η 2  = .08, all p s <.001). For expectedness, there were no differences between emotions ( F (4.93,1705.07) = 1.99; p >.05).  Secondly, from Table 2 it appears that, for all strategies, there were significant differences between emotions (for rumination F (4.80,1656.66) = 84.71; partial η 2  = .20; for reflection F (4.99,1725.42) = 50.33; partial η 2  = .13; for reappraisal F (4.95,1713.95) = 28.17; partial η 2  = .08; for suppression F (4.92,1703.92) = 21.49; partial η 2  = .06; for distraction F (4.83, 1672.55) = 12.60; partial η 2  = .04; all ps <.001). Interestingly, it appeared that for all strategies regulatory effort was highest in case of sadness and lowest in case of disgust.  Finally, we also investigated the correlations between appraisals and regulation strategies for each emotion separately (see Tables S1–S6 in File S1 ). The results largely generalized across emotions, except for sadness where relationships were found to be somewhat less outspoken. It appeared that a) importance, advantageousness, impact on self-image, and immorality were significantly and positively associated with the use of emotion-regulation strategies, and b) emotion-focused coping was significantly and negatively associated with the use of emotion-regulation strategies. For the other appraisal dimensions, the results varied depending on the specific regulation strategy or emotion under study.   Regression Analyses   Strength of associations: effect sizes  Table 3 reflects the amount of variability in intensity (or duration) explained by (a) all appraisals and regulation strategies simultaneously; (b) all appraisals simultaneously (with and without controlling for regulation strategies); and (c) all regulation strategies simultaneously (with and without controlling for all appraisal strategies).  10.1371/journal.pone.0092410.t003 Table 3  Proportion of Variability in Intensity and Duration Explained by Appraisals and Emotion-regulation Strategies simultaneously, by Appraisals with and without Controlling for Regulation, and by Regulation with and without Controlling for Appraisal.

When intensity was predicted by all classes of determinants simultaneously, it appeared that the percentage of variability explained ranged from 24% (disgust) up to 43% (guilt), with a median of 30%. For duration, it appeared that, the percentage of variability explained by all classes of determinants jointly ranged from 28% (anger and fear) up to 36% (disgust) with a median of 33%.  Secondly, we investigated the percentage of variability explained by appraisals. For intensity, the percentage of variability explained by a model including all appraisal dimensions simultaneously, ranged from 21% (disgust) up to 39% (guilt) with a median of 28%. When investigating a model in which we first added all regulation strategies and in a second step all appraisal dimensions, it appeared that appraisals uniquely predicted between 7% (disgust and shame) and 19% (sadness) of variability in intensity with a median of 13%. For duration, the percentage of variability explained by the model including all appraisal dimensions simultaneously ranged from 22% (anger) up to 33% (disgust) with a median of 26%. When investigating a model in which we first added all regulation strategies and in a second step all appraisal dimensions, it appeared that appraisals uniquely predicted between 4% (anger) and 23% (sadness) of variability in duration with a median of 7%.  Finally, we investigated the percentage of variability explained by emotion-regulation strategies. For intensity, the percentage of variability explained by a model including all emotion-regulation strategies ranged from 12% (fear and sadness) up to 30% (guilt) with a median of 16%. When investigating a model in which we added all appraisal dimensions in a first step and all regulation strategies in a second step, it appeared that regulation uniquely predicted between 1% (fear and anger) and 4% (guilt) of variability in intensity with a median of 2%.  For duration, the percentage of variability explained by a model including all emotion-regulation strategies ranged from 9% (sadness) up to 28% (disgust) with a median of 25%. When investigating a model in which first all appraisals dimensions and then all regulation strategies it appeared that regulation uniquely predicted between 1% (sadness) and 9% (guilt) of variability in duration with a median of 5%.

Note . Only significant regression weights are displayed in the table.  When predicting emotion intensity by all appraisal dimensions simultaneously, it was found that, for all emotions under study, importance of the emotion-eliciting event was positively related to emotion intensity. Moreover, in line with the mismatch hypothesis, for almost all emotions (except for disgust) it appeared that the more disadvantageous the emotion-eliciting event was perceived, the more intense the emotion was. Also, for almost all emotions under study (except for shame and disgust), emotion-focused coping was significantly negatively related to intensity, suggesting that the more one could cope with the emotions elicited by the event, the less intense the emotion was. For the other appraisal dimensions expressing a mismatch (immorality, self-image, injustice) some of the expected relations were found, but they did not generalize across emotions. For example, events with negative consequences for the self-image were positively associated with emotion intensity but only in case of guilt and shame. Finally, as expected it was found that expectedness, and, own and other responsibility did not predict intensity.  When predicting emotion duration by all appraisal dimensions simultaneously, it was found that, for all emotions under study, importance of the emotion-eliciting event was positively associated with emotion duration. Furthermore, in line with the mismatch hypothesis, it appeared that for almost all emotions under study (except for sadness) the more an event had a negative impact on one’s self-image the longer the emotion lasted. Moreover, for all emotions (except for fear) it appeared that emotion-focused coping was associated negatively with emotion duration. For the other appraisal dimensions expressing a mismatch (disadvantageousness, immorality, and injustice) some of the expected relations were found, but these did not generalize across emotions. For example, immorality was positively related to the duration of sadness, anger, and shame. Finally, similar to the findings for intensity, expectedness did not predict duration (except for fear). Also, other and own responsibility were not related to the duration of emotion episodes.  The standardized regression weights obtained when predicting emotion intensity or duration by all regulation strategies simultaneously are presented in Table 5 . To ease readability only significant regression weights are displayed in the table (the complete table can be found in Table S8 in File S2 ).  10.1371/journal.pone.0092410.t005 Table 5  Standardized Regression Weights for the Emotion-regulation strategies when Predicting Intensity and Duration of Emotion Episodes.

Note . Only significant regression weights are displayed in the table.  When predicting emotion intensity by all regulation strategies, it was found that rumination was positively associated with intensity for all emotions under study. However, the other four strategies did not consistently predict intensity. This may seem rather surprising as some of the other investigated strategies have been shown to be negatively related to intensity in previous research (e.g., reappraisal).  However, this lack of significant negative relationships may be explained by the existence of a reciprocal relation between regulation and emotion intensity [3] , [9] : Regulation strategies do not only influence emotion intensity but intensity also influences regulation. Importantly, in contrast to the influence of regulation on intensity the influence of intensity on emotion regulation does not seem to depend much on the nature of the regulation strategy. Indeed, more intense experiences were found to initiate the use of a wide range of regulatory strategies [15] . As the influence from intensity to regulation is typically positive (more intense emotions require more regulation), one may find positive or null relationships between certain regulation strategies and intensity in correlational data, even when the influence of regulation on intensity is actually negative [9] .  A possible way to deal with this is to control for the overall amount of emotion regulation [31] . Therefore, we ran a number of additional analyses in which intensity was predicted by a particular emotion regulation strategy and the mean use of all regulation strategies. Importantly, in these models, the regression weight of a particular emotion regulation strategy expresses the increase or decrease in intensity when this strategy is used relatively more (at the cost of the other strategies under study). Results from the additional analyses are presented in Table 6 . To ease readability only significant regression weights are displayed in the table (the complete table can be found in Table S9 in File S2 ).  10.1371/journal.pone.0092410.t006 Table 6  Standardized Regression Weights for the Emotion-regulation strategies when Predicting Intensity and Duration of Emotion Episodes while Controlling for Mean Emotion Regulation.

Note . Only significant regression weights are displayed in the table.  From this table it can be seen that, for all emotions, rumination predicted intensity positively, and reappraisal predicted intensity negatively. This means that if rumination is used relatively more, intensity will increase, whereas if one reappraises relatively more, intensity will decrease. Furthermore it appeared that, for all emotions under study, except for anger, expressive suppression was negatively related to intensity. Also, distraction was negatively associated with the intensity of sadness, fear, and disgust. Finally, reflection did not predict intensity. In addition it appeared that the mean use of emotion-regulation strategies was typically significantly positively related to intensity, meaning that more intense emotion episodes were associated with more overall regulation.  When predicting emotion duration by all regulation strategies, it was found that, similar to intensity, for all emotions under study, rumination was positively related to duration. The other four strategies did not consistently predict duration. Again, this is most likely due to the reciprocal relation between duration and regulation. Therefore, similar to what was done for intensity, we controlled for the mean use of emotion regulation in subsequent analyses (see Table 6 ). It appears that, for all emotions, rumination positively predicted the duration of the episode, meaning that if one ruminates relatively more, the episode will last relatively long. Furthermore, suppression negatively predicted the duration of anger, fear, shame, and disgust episodes. Also, reappraisal negatively predicted the duration of sadness, anger, guilt, and shame episodes. Finally, distraction negatively predicted the duration of shame and disgust episodes, whereas reflection was positively related to the duration of these emotions. Again it appeared that, in general, the mean use of emotion-regulation strategies was positively related to duration, meaning that longer emotion episodes were associated with more overall regulation.   Discussion  Intensity and duration are two central features of an emotional experience. Previous research revealed that emotion episodes display large variability in these features [4] , [7] . In the present study, we systemically examined to what degree appraisals and emotion-regulation strategies can account for this variability. However, before addressing the results regarding this central research aim, we will briefly discuss our findings regarding (a) variability in intensity and duration between emotions, (b) variability in appraisals and regulation strategies between emotions, (c) the correlations between appraisals and regulation strategies and, (d) the correlation between emotion intensity and duration.   Variability in Intensity and Duration between Emotions  Emotions differ in their average level of intensity and duration. Interestingly, a rather similar emotion order was found for intensity and duration. In particular, episodes of sadness were the most intense and lasted the longest, followed by anger, which in turn lasted longer and was more intense than episodes of guilt and fear. Episodes of shame and disgust lasted on average the shortest and were the least intense. This order is highly similar to the order that has been found in previous research on intensity [22] and duration [6] , [17] , [19] . One may conjecture that this order is explained by differences in appraisals between emotions: For example, the finding that episodes of sadness are elicited by events that are perceived as very important and hard to cope with may account for the relatively high intensity and long duration of sadness. Similarly, the finding that episodes of disgust are elicited by rather unimportant events that are easy to cope with may explain the rather low intensity and short duration of disgust.   Variability in Appraisals and Regulation Strategies between Emotions  For both appraisals and regulation strategies evidence for variability between emotions was found. For appraisals, our findings match with previous research on appraisal theory: For example, anger and disgust have been associated with a violation of norms by someone else [32] , [33] ; accordingly, in the present study, episodes of these emotions were rated highest on other responsibility, injustice, and immorality. Also, sadness has been linked to low coping potential [34] and consistent with this, episodes of sadness were rated lowest on emotion-focused coping in the present study. Previously, fear has been linked with low emotion-focused coping [34] , and in the present study, episodes of fear scored relatively low on this dimension compared to the other emotions under study. Finally, shame and guilt, two negative self-conscious emotions [35] were rated as having the most negative consequences for one’s self-image.  For regulation, it appeared that, for all strategies under study, regulatory effort was highest in case of sadness. This is interesting given that sadness was found to be a rather intense and long lasting emotion associated with low coping potential. This pattern of findings suggests that despite the low coping potential people try out a wide range of strategies but these strategies appear to be insufficient to compensate for the high levels of event importance that are characteristic for sadness. Furthermore, regulatory effort was the lowest for disgust, an emotion that was found to be rather low in intensity, short in duration and associated with high coping potential. This may reflect that participants are very efficient when regulating experiences of disgust, which are typically caused by rather unimportant events.   The Relation between Appraisals and Emotion-regulation Strategies  Events that are appraised as important, disadvantageous, immoral, and having negatives consequences for one’s self image, were found to be positively associated with the use of a wide range of regulation strategies. As such, it seems that events that cause multiple mismatches (with one’s goals, norms or self-ideal) motivate the individual to take action to deal with the event and associated emotion. In contrast, emotion focused coping was found to be negatively related to the use of emotion regulation. High emotion focused coping may result from the feeling that no action is needed to deal with the emotion, which in turn results in a limited use of regulation strategies.   The Relation between Emotion Intensity and Duration  Consistent with previous studies [5] , [20] , it appeared that emotion intensity and duration were only moderately correlated, with a median correlation of.38. This result is also consistent with a recent study [18] in which a median correlation between emotion intensity and duration of.39 was found. Interestingly, the lowest correlation was found for fear ( r  = .27). This difference between emotions may be explained by the manner in which emotions end [5] , [18] : For example, fear episodes end rather often when the object of fear is removed (e.g., stage fright quickly dissipates when the performance is over) regardless of the intensity of the fear episode. For other negative emotions this seems to be less the case. These moderate correlations between intensity and duration imply that the relative predictive power of appraisals and emotion regulation may be different for emotion intensity and duration as discussed in the next section.   Explaining Variability in Intensity and Duration: Appraisals and Regulation Strategies  Together, appraisals and regulation strategies explained about one third of the total variability in intensity and duration. A highly similar number was found for intensity in the study of Sonnemans and Frijda [9] . This result also implies that about two third of the total variability in intensity and duration was unexplained. A combination of several factors may be responsible for this result. First, in addition to appraisals and regulation strategies, other classes of predictors may play a role. In this context, it is notable that Frijda and colleagues argued that dispositions are another class of possible predictors of intensity [9] . However, it is not certain whether including this class would have substantially increased the percentage of explained variability given that in previous studies dispositions appeared to play a minor role compared to the two other classes of predictors [6] , [9] . Second, although within each class of determinants, the most central predictors were included, some important variables may have been missing. For example, two frequently employed regulation strategies that were not investigated in the present study are social sharing [36] and self-distancing [37] . As such, including of a wider range of predictors within each class could also increase the percentage of variability explained.  Further, although both appraisals and regulation strategies were found to explain variability in intensity and duration, appraisals were found, as expected, to be stronger predictors of emotion intensity compared to emotion-regulation strategies. In contrast, for emotion duration, appraisals and regulation strategies were found to be more or less equally predictive. This confirms our expectation that regulation strategies are especially important to account for features reflecting emotional recovery such as emotion duration. However, it also shows that the role of appraisals is not restricted to the period of emotion elicitation and blossoming but that, instead, appraisals are predictive of emotion dynamics throughout the entire emotional episode. Interestingly, for both emotion duration and intensity, the predictive power of appraisals (regulation) strongly decreased when controlling for regulation (appraisals), suggesting that the effect of appraisals (regulation) on duration and intensity is partially mediated by regulation (appraisals).  Finally, we examined the relation between specific appraisals and regulation strategies on the one hand, and emotion intensity and duration on the other hand. Regarding appraisals, it was found that the importance of the emotion-eliciting event is positively related to both emotion intensity and duration. Furthermore, the study provided support for the mismatch hypothesis for both intensity and duration. For example, emotion-focused coping was negatively related with both the intensity and duration of negative emotions. However, the relation between appraisals and intensity differs to some extent from the relation between appraisals and duration. In this regard, it appeared that, across emotions, disadvantageousness of the emotion-eliciting event positively predicted intensity whereas duration was especially well predicted by the impact of the event on one’s self-image. These findings suggest that intensity is more strongly determined by the general adversity of the emotion-eliciting event, whereas duration depends more strongly on a specific form of adversity, that is, how negative the event is for one’s self-image. This may be explained by symbolic interactionist notions of the self [38] in which it is suggested that events that lead to a negative evaluation of the self are very pre-occupying (and so their impact may last longer) as they may require an adjustment of one’s self concept. Finally, it is notable that, in line with our predictions, expectedness and, own and other accountability were not related to intensity and duration of negative emotions.  Regarding regulation, a positive relation between rumination and emotion intensity and duration was found. Moreover, when controlling for the total amount of emotion regulation, an additional negative relationship between reappraisal and expressive suppression on the one hand and emotion intensity and duration on the other hand was found. Concerning rumination and reappraisal, these results are consistent with previous research showing these strategies to be maladaptive and adaptive, respectively [39] . For expressive suppression, the effect was not in line with our expectation that suppression would be a maladaptive strategy strengthening negative emotions. However, these results do line up with results from a recent meta-analysis [25] showing that expressive suppression may have positive consequences.   Limitations of the Present Study  Although the present study provided some valuable insights regarding determinants of emotion intensity and duration, it is not without limitations. First, the collected data are cross-sectional in nature and, consequently, causal claims should be made carefully.  Second, participants were asked to report retrospectively on emotions. Even though the majority of reported episodes took place within the days and weeks preceding the study, part of the episodes took place longer ago. In previous studies, it has been shown that when participants are asked to report on emotional experiences that occurred recently, episodic information is used, whereas semantic knowledge is used when the emotional experience occurred a long time ago [40] . As a result, whereas estimates of the intensity and duration of recent emotions may reflect actual intensity and duration, estimates of the intensity and duration of emotions that occurred a long time ago may reflect perceived intensity and duration. However, even if semantic knowledge plays a role, this does not necessarily invalidate the intensity and duration estimates as according to the lexical sedimentation hypothesis [41] stable aspects of behavioral phenomena are encoded in lexical structure. Nevertheless, we performed a series of secondary analyses including only the episodes that occurred recently (days and weeks ago) and re-examined the relationship between appraisals and regulation strategies on the one hand, and emotion intensity and duration on the other hand. These analyses led to a pattern of results that was highly similar to the pattern obtained when all episodes were included. As such, the obtained conclusions are not strongly affected by the retrospective nature of the design.  Nevertheless, it may be worthwhile to replicate the current findings in future studies using online data collection methods such as experience sampling (ESM). An important advantage of these methods is that the collected data are not affected by any memory biases. However, it should be noted that it is not that straightforward to study emotion duration using an ESM approach. In particular, as the duration of an uninterrupted emotional episode is highly variable with durations ranging from a couple of seconds up until several hours, a typical ESM sampling rate may not be able to capture such a process very well (missing the exact onset, end, or even the total episode). Setting the sampling rate very high is also no perfect solution as this may give rise to artificial mental reappearances of the emotion-eliciting event, which have been shown to prolong the emotional experience [6] .  Third, in the present study we focused on negative emotions. It would be interesting to extend the present findings to positive emotions, especially since in a number of recent studies researchers have started to investigate the appraisal basis of different positive emotions [42] . For positive emotions, a match hypothesis could be formulated, in that, events that are perceived as congruent with one’s goals, self-ideal, and values would elicit the most intense and long lasting positive emotions. Similarly, in some recent studies researchers have started to investigate the strategies that are used to regulate positive emotions [43] and it would be interesting to relate those strategies to both emotion intensity and duration.

Positive moods are thought to restore self-control resources following depletion. However, it is not well understood whether this effect is due to affective valence (pleasantness), arousal (activation), or a combination of both. Across four studies, we set out to investigate the role of positive moods on cognitive and behavioral measures of self-regulation in an ego-depletion paradigm. In studies 1 and 2, we independently manipulated affective valence and arousal and assessed self-regulation with a Stroop task. Results did not suggest a restorative effect of either on cognitive resources. In study 3, we employed both behavioral (the ‘handgrip task’) and cognitive (Stroop) assessments of self-regulation. Again, no significant effect of mood was observed on the Stroop task. Additionally, participants did not persist significantly longer on the handgrip task following a positive mood induction. Finally, in study 4, high vs. low states of arousal were manipulated and self-regulation was assessed via pre- and post-manipulation Stroop performance. In study 4, Stroop performance improved slightly more across time points for those in the high arousal condition than for those in the low arousal condition. Therefore, across four studies, we failed to find a consistent pattern of results suggesting that positive moods restore cognitive resources.

In contrast, self-regulatory failure is associated with increased drug use, higher rates of criminal convictions, and physical health problems [ 1 ]. Given the implications of self-regulatory success and failure in various life domains, it is important to determine the factors that facilitate successful self-regulation.  A series of studies conducted by Tice and colleagues [ 2 ] suggest that experiencing positive emotions may help people self-regulate more effectively when their self-control might otherwise fail [ 2 ]. However, these studies were not optimally suited to determine whether this effect was due the valence (i.e., pleasantness) or arousal (i.e., activation) of the positive emotions. Here we report on four studies that examine the relationship between mood and self-regulation by manipulating moods’ valance and arousal, and testing effects on cognitive and behavioral control.   Valence versus arousal  In contrast to conceptualizing emotions as discrete entities [ 3 ], researchers often consider emotions, and affective states more broadly, from a dimensional perspective. With this approach, feeling states are organized according to co-occurrence or experiential similarity. Different feelings fit within a two-dimensional space, referred to as the affect circumplex [ 4 ]. Commonly—and in the paper by Tice et al. [ 2 ] and the current investigation—these dimensions of affect are defined as valence and arousal.  In the affect circumplex, positive moods may be either high or low arousal [ 4 ]. For example, joy and excitement are positive, high arousal moods, whereas contentment and relaxation are positive, low arousal moods. Popular measures of affect, such as the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) [ 5 ], often focus on activated pleasant states. Absent careful attention to assessment or manipulation of lower arousal pleasant states, the effects of positive moods on self-regulation could conceivably result from the valence of the mood, the arousal of the mood, or both.    Ego-Depletion & Affect  “Ego-depletion” refers to the state of mental fatigue that results from the exertion of self-control [ 6 ]. Of the various models proposed to explain the depletion effect, the strength model has been subject to the most empirical investigation. The results of numerous studies are consistent with this model; however, there is also ongoing debate about the extent to which strong depletion effects may be attributable to publication bias (e.g., [ 7 ][ 8 ]). According to the limited strength model of self-control, self-regulation functions analogous to a muscle in that it becomes fatigued with use, is restored naturally with rest, and is strengthened with repeated use [ 9 ]. Accordingly, depletion is thought to affect a shared resource, such that the depletion of this resource can diminish self-regulation of behavioral inhibition, emotional regulation, and cognitive control. Thus, inhibiting a behavior can subsequently hinder attempts to regulate emotion or perform complex cognitive tasks, and vice versa [ 9 ] [ 10 ]. Automatic processes, however, do not share this common resource and thus do not contribute to, and are not affected by, states of resource depletion [ 11 ].  Factors that facilitate self-control when mental resources are depleted include being motivated to perform the task [ 12 ] and affirming one’s core values [ 13 ]. Additionally, Tice, Baumeister, Schmeuli & Muraven [ 2 ] found that experiencing positive emotions facilitates self-regulatory success following earlier depletion.  Across four studies by Tice et al. [ 2 ], experiencing positive moods after being depleted had a restorative effect on people’s ability to self-regulate. Participants were initially depleted using various strategies, including thought suppression, behavioral inhibition, and habit-breaking tasks. Participants were then put into positive, sad, or neutral moods with video clips or through receiving either a surprise gift (positive) or a paper receipt (neutral). Available mental resources were then measured with task persistence or muscular endurance. The researchers found that people who experienced positive moods after their mental energy was depleted were able to perform tasks with the same degree of efficiency as people who had not been depleted. Those who were depleted and experienced either neutral or negative emotions had poorer performance on whatever measurement task was used in the given study [ 2 ]. Although these effects appeared uniformly across these four studies, the effect of pleasant moods may be confounded, at least in part, by other aspects of affect (e.g., arousal).  In their third study, Tice et al. [ 2 ] address this issue directly. Because they used a mood scale that contained both a valence and an arousal subscale, the authors separated valence and arousal statistically to test which dimensions independently predicted their outcome measure (persistence on a hand-grip task). The authors concluded that the valence of the mood, rather than the arousal, was responsible for increased performance on the hand-grip task [ 2 ]. However, a single test with a small sample size (N = 42) is not conclusive. A more powerful strategy would be to independently manipulate arousal and valence (i.e., rather than merely assess them), and this is the approach we have taken.  Instead of bringing clarity to the issue, other research suggests an uncertain role of arousal in restoring self-regulatory resources. High-arousal states are thought to interfere with performance on the classic Stroop task—used to assess depletion because it requires inhibition—while low-arousal states facilitate performance [ 14 ]. However, in one ego-depletion study, people in a depleted state reported a higher incidence of subjective fatigue or tiredness than those who were not depleted [ 9 ]. Although no causal relationship is identified, it suggests that low arousal coincides with states of depletion. In sum, the role of arousal in restoration is complex and not well understood. Further research with improved methodology should help clarify the issue.    Current studies  The present research was designed to further explore the restorative effect of positive emotions on self-regulatory resources by extending the results to different outcome measures and offering improved methodology to clarify the role of valence and arousal in this process. Across four studies, we use an ego-depletion paradigm to investigate the effects of affective valence and arousal on cognitive control.  In study 1, we used a lab-based mood induction (music & images), and examined the effect on response-inhibition via performance on a Stroop task [ 15 ]. In study 2, we used a more experiential mood induction (walking vs. sitting in pleasant vs. neutral surroundings) along with the same depletion and measurement tasks as in study 1. Studies 1 and 2 did not provide strong support that affective valence or arousal produce restorative effects on cognitive control. Thus, in study 3 we employed an experimental approach more closely resembling the design and handgrip measure employed by Tice et al [ 2 ] in an attempt to replicate the original findings. In study 4, we focused on manipulating arousal (high vs. low) via physical exertion (exercise vs. sitting) and examined the effect on Stroop performance.     Study 1  We made two hypotheses for study 1. First, according to ego-depletion theory and research (i.e., a shared resource exists and is restored by pleasant moods), we hypothesized that those people who experience pleasant moods after being depleted will show improved performance on a cognitive control task relative to those people who experience neutral moods. Second, in line with hints from previous research [ 2 ] [ 14 ], we did not expect that arousal would improve performance.   Methods   Participants  Participants were recruited from a university participant pool consisting of undergraduate students enrolled in first and second year psychology classes. Participants received course credit for their participation. The Carleton University Ethics Committee for Psychological Research approved this experiment. Data was collected from 131 students, and 22 were excluded from analysis for not following task instructions ( n = 20), or disclosing color-blindness ( n = 1) or an attention disorder ( n = 1). Analysis included 109 participants (50 = male, 50 = female, 9 = unspecified), between the ages of 17 and 50 ( M = 21.07, SD = 5.18). Twenty-seven participants (25.7%) reported a preference for classical music, and 30 participants (28.4%) reported having formal musical training ( M = 5.39 years, SD = 3.6 years). All participants provided written consent to participate in the study.    Procedure  After giving informed consent, participants completed a short package of demographic and personality questionnaires. Participants then completed a habit-breaking task to deplete their self-regulatory resources. Following this task, the Stroop task [ 15 ] was administered to each participant to obtain a baseline for speed and accuracy while in a depleted state. Participants were randomly assigned to one of four mood conditions: positive high-arousal, positive low-arousal, neutral high-arousal, and neutral low-arousal. Participants were randomly assigned to watch one of the 5-minute video clips to put them into one of the desired mood states. After the video, participants completed a measure of their mood state. The Stroop task was administered to participants a second time to measure cognitive performance following the mood induction. Participants were then given verbal and written debriefing, with a probe for suspicion regarding the true intentions of the study.     Materials   Background information and personality  Participants completed a short self-report demographic questionnaire, which included questions relating to their gender, age, year of study, program of study, music preferences, and music training. Additional questionnaires assessing personality variables were also collected, but were not included in analysis.    State mood  Participants’ state mood was measured with a 27-item questionnaire with mood adjectives from the affect circumplex [ 4 ]. This included adjectives related to arousal ( stimulated , full of energy , quiet , tired ) and valence ( happy , pleased , unhappy , sad ). Other adjectives, similar to those used in the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS; [ 16 ]), were included but not used in analysis due to their composition of both valence and arousal dimensions. Participants were asked to, “indicate to what extent [they] feel this way right now, at this moment” on a 7-point Likert Scale from very slightly or not at all (1) to extremely or a lot (7) for each of the adjectives. Valence was calculated by averaging the two pure positive valence items ( happy , pleased ) and the reverse-scored pure negative valence items ( sad , unhappy ). Arousal was calculated by averaging the two pure high arousal items ( full of energy , stimulated ) and the reverse-scored pure low-arousal items ( quiet , tired ). Internal consistency was acceptable for both valence ( α = .78) and arousal ( α = .69).    Depletion task  Self-regulatory resources were depleted using a habit-breaking task. In this task, participants were first asked to read a book excerpt about the history of political thought (454 words; [ 17 ]) and cross out every letter ‘e’ that they found so that a habit was created. Participants were then asked to read a second excerpt from the same book (391 words) and cross out every letter ‘e’ that they saw, except if the letter ‘e’ was beside a vowel, or one letter away from a vowel. This forced participants to override their previously learned habit. This task was among the most widely used, effective, and consistent depletion techniques evaluated in a meta-analysis [ 18 ] and was used in two of the four restoration studies that motivated this research [ 2 ].    Mood induction  Mood was induced using a combination of images from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS; [ 19 ]), and instrumental music recordings. The images and music were compiled into five-minute long videos. Each video was composed of 50 unique images (each displayed for 5 seconds), with a 1 second fade between each image. A 3 second fade was applied to the music at the beginning and end of the videos to avoid abrupt changes in volume. Participants were instructed to watch the videos and pay attention to the images and music. Mood conditions varied orthogonally by valence (positive, neutral) and arousal (high, low), which created four mood conditions: (positive high-arousal, positive low-arousal, neutral high-arousal, neutral low-arousal).  The positive high-arousal condition contained images with positive and active themes (e.g., victorious athletes, children on waterslides, etc.) along with music from Slavonic Dance No . 5 in A Major by Antonin Dvorak [ 20 ]. The positive low-arousal condition contained images with positive but relaxing themes (e.g., smiling faces, landscapes, etc.) along with music from Venus , the Bringer of Peace by Gustav Holst [ 21 ]. The neutral high-arousal condition contained images with active but neither pleasant nor unpleasant themes (e.g., an emergency room, busy urban environments, etc.) along with music from Mars , the Bringer of War by Gustav Holst [ 21 ]. The neutral low-arousal condition contained images that were not active, and neither pleasant nor unpleasant (e.g., neutral faces, household objects) along with music from Adagio for Strings by Samuel Barber [ 22 ].  IAPS photos were chosen according to their published valence and arousal ratings [ 19 ], and musical selections were chosen according to previous research [ 23 ] [ 24 ]. The combination of IAPS photos and instrumental music has been used successfully in previous research as an independent manipulation of valence and arousal [ 25 ], and a pilot study verified that the mood induction had the desired effect on mood. The 200 IAPS photos used in the experimental manipulation are listed online with the publicly available datasets.    Cognitive control task  Cognitive control was measured using a computer-administered Stroop task [ 15 ]. This involved presenting participants with color names (red, green, blue, yellow, and purple) that were printed in text that was either color-congruent (e.g., the word ‘red’ printed in red text) or color-incongruent (e.g., the word ‘red’ printed in green text). Participants were asked to identify the color of the text, not the word, for each trial using a special keypad with a button for each color (from left to right: red, yellow, green, blue, and purple). Participants were instructed to respond as quickly and accurately as possible during the task. Research has validated the Stroop task as a measure of cognitive control in self-regulation research [ 18 ] [ 26 ].  The task consisted of 325 trials in total. Of these, 65 trials (20%) were color-congruent, and 260 (80%) were color-incongruent. These were randomly presented in 13 experimental blocks with 25 trials in each block. In each block, each possible combination of color name and color text (including color-congruent and color-incongruent trials) was presented once in random order. This task took approximately 5 minutes to complete.  Stroop data was cleaned and processed in R [ 27 ] and was done consistently across the four studies. Visual inspection of data indicated observable practice effects in the initial blocks of the Stroop task, so the first 50 trials were considered “practice” and were not retained in subsequent analyses. In studies involving pre- and post-induction Stroop tasks (i.e., study 1 and study 4), practice effects were observable only in the first Stroop task, and thus all 325 trials were retained in post-Stroop tasks. We examined an alternative trimming strategy where the first 50 trials were removed from both tasks in studies 1 and 4 (to keep this constant); scores were correlated r > .95 across criteria, and no results differed meaningfully with alternative scores.  To account for accidental key presses and lapses in attention, only response times between 100 ms and 5000 ms were considered true responses, and values outside this range were classified as missing. Response times, in milliseconds, were then log transformed to better approximate a normal distribution and outliers were identified within each participant separately. Responses greater than three standard deviations from the individual’s mean were classified as missing. Across all four studies, 98.4% of trials were retained for analysis. Trimmed data were used to calculate mean log response times, incongruent RTs (RTs from incongruent trials), interference scores (calculated by subtracting congruent from incongruent RTs), accuracy scores (percentage of correct trials), and accuracy interference scores (calculated by subtracting congruent from incongruent accuracy). All calculations are available in the accompanying data set; however, only mean log RTs are reported in this manuscript as analyses with these alternative scoring schemes did not produce any consistent pattern of divergent results.     Results   Preliminary Analyses  Because people’s musical preferences and past musical training might influence the efficacy of the mood induction, both of these factors were investigated. There were no significant differences by condition among people who reported a preference for classical music, χ 2 (3, N = 109) = .75, p = .86, and of people who reported formal training in music, χ 2 (3, N = 109) = 1.91, p = .59. Neither preference for classical music nor past musical training influenced the results. Because frequencies were not different between mood conditions and the two variables were unrelated to our dependent measures, they were not included as covariates in further analyses.    Manipulation check  To determine whether the mood induction was successful at putting people into the desired moods, we conducted two separate ANOVAs: one on self-reported valence, and one on self-reported arousal. A 2 (valence) x 2 (arousal) between-subjects ANOVA was conducted on self-reported valence. There was a significant main effect of valence in the valence condition, F (1, 105) = 14.99, p < .001, partial η 2 = .12, but no significant main effect of arousal in the valence condition, F (1, 105) = 3.33, p = .07, partial η 2 = .03. No significant valence x arousal interaction was present, F (1, 105) = 0.55, p = .46, partial η 2 = .01. Thus those watching the pleasant videos reported more pleasant emotions ( M = 5.12, SD = 1.15) than those watching the neutral videos ( M = 4.10, SD = 1.29). In contrast, those who watched the high-arousal videos ( M = 5.35, SD = 1.22) did not report significantly more pleasant emotions than those who watched the low-arousal videos ( M = 4.67, SD = .87).  A 2 (valence) x 2 (arousal) between-subjects ANOVA was also conducted on self-reported arousal. There was no main effect for valence conditions on self-reported arousal, F (1, 105) < .01, p = .95, partial η 2 = .00, but a main effect was found for arousal conditions on self-reported arousal, F (1, 105) = 15.89, p < .001, partial η 2 = .13. No valence x arousal interaction was found, F (1, 105) = .64, p = .43, partial η 2 = .01. This shows that those who watched the high arousal videos reported greater arousal ( M = 3.97, SD = 1.04) than those who watched the low arousal videos ( M = 2.88, SD = 1.03), while those who watched the pleasant videos reported a similar amount of arousal ( M = 3.81, SD = 1.50) as those who watched the neutral videos ( M = 3.07, SD = 1.17).    Effect of Mood on Cognitive Performance  A 2 (valence) x 2 (arousal) x 2 (time) mixed-factors ANOVA was conducted on mean Stroop response times. A significant main effect of time on Stroop response time was found across the two time points indicating that, on average, response times decreased across time points, F (1, 105) = 389.48, p < .001, partial η 2 = .79, but no significant main effect was found for either valence, F (1,105) = 1.03, p = .31, partial η 2 = .01, or arousal conditions, F (1,105) = .63, p = .43, partial η 2 = .01. A marginally significant valence x time interaction was found, F (1,105) = 3.73, p = .06, partial η 2 = .03, indicating the decrease in response times across time points was greater for neutral valence conditions than positive valence conditions. This interaction pattern was inconsistent with hypotheses. No other interactions were found to be significant, including valence x arousal, F (1,105) = 1.50, p = .22, partial η 2 = .01, arousal x time, F (1, 105) = 3.22, p = .08, partial η 2 = .03 or valence x arousal x time, F (1, 105) = 2.66, p = .11, partial η 2 = .03.

Particularly, we made methodological improvements (e.g., independent manipulation of valence and arousal) to better understand which dimensions of mood might be responsible for this effect (if it exists). To accomplish this, we depleted participants’ resources, measured their cognitive control, induced moods that varied independently by valence and arousal, and re-measured their cognitive control. We expected that people in the positive valence mood conditions would show an improvement of cognitive control relative to those in neutral valence mood conditions. In line with previous research, we expected that differences in arousal would play a minor role in restoration.  Surprisingly, despite successful mood inductions, we failed to find a unique restorative effect of either valence or arousal on self-regulatory resources. We observed a substantial decrease in response time when comparing performance before and after the mood induction, indicating that restoration did occur. This effect, however, did not differ significantly based on valence, arousal, or a combination of the two dimensions. A marginally significant valence by time interaction was observed; however, the pattern suggested that restoration was facilitated more by neutral valence than positive valence. Whether we failed to find an effect of positive valence due to our method of mood induction or type of self-regulatory resources is ambiguous. In light of these results, we decided to conduct a follow-up study using a different method of mood induction to better approximate mood states as experienced on a daily basis.     Study 2  In study 2, we modified some of the elements from study 1 while retaining its core features. In this study, we conducted an experiential mood induction outside of the lab (walking vs. sitting in pleasant vs. neutral surroundings) and compared differences in post-induction Stroop performance between groups. Our hypotheses were the same as those in study 1.   Method   Participants  Participants were again recruited from a university participant pool and were awarded course credit for their participation. A total of 159 participants were tested with 43 excluded from analysis. This was due to rainy weather on the day of the experiment ( n = 29, which meant we could not randomly assign to the outdoor conditions), for not following instructions ( n = 4), or for not completing the study in a reasonable timeframe ( n = 10). Analysis included 116 participants (44 male, 66 female, 6 unspecified) between the ages of 17 and 37 years ( M = 19.7, SD = 2.83). This study was approved by the Carleton University Ethics Committee for Psychological Research. Participants provided written consent to participate in the study.     Materials   Background information and personality  Participants completed self-report questionnaires about background and personality information similar to that in study 1.    State mood  State mood was measured before and after the mood induction using a 24-item version of the mood questionnaire [ 16 ]. Because there is some debate about how closely tired corresponds to pure low-arousal [ 28 ], this adjective was replaced with idle to better capture a state of inactivity. This modification did not substantially alter the inter-item reliability of the scale (valence α = .73; arousal α = .61).    Depletion task  The habit-breaking task used in study 1 was again used as a method of depleting self-regulatory resources.    Mood induction  Mood was induced between-subjects so that participants differed in both valence (positive vs. neutral) and arousal (high vs. low). This resulted in four distinct moods: positive-high arousal, positive-low arousal, neutral-high arousal, and neutral-low arousal. Valence was manipulated by varying the environment that participants were exposed to, including natural outdoor environments around campus (positive valence) and artificial indoor environments in the campus tunnel system (neutral valence; cf., [ 29 ]). Physical activity was varied during this exposure to create high arousal (brisk walking) and low arousal (sitting) conditions (cf., [ 30 ]). Each induction lasted approximately 12 minutes. Walking routes were matched for total distance, and sitting locations were matched for distance from the lab. Walking speed was kept constant throughout the induction and between sessions.    Cognitive control task  The same Stroop task used in study 1 was again used to measure cognitive control.    Procedure  Participants arrived at the lab ostensibly for a study about the effect of campus environments on mental functioning. Participants were run in groups of between one and three people. Each group was randomly assigned to an experimental condition (positive-high arousal, positive-low arousal, neutral-high arousal, neutral-low arousal) before the session began. Each participant was seated in a separate room. After obtaining informed consent, participants completed questionnaires relating to background information and personality. Participants were then given the depletion (habit breaking) task to deplete their mental resources, which took approximately 15 minutes to complete. Participants completed a questionnaire to measure their state mood at that moment.  The experimental groups then received the mood induction procedure according to their assigned condition. In both conditions participants walked approximately 600 meters. In each condition, participants were asked to observe and be attentive to their environment and to keep interactions among themselves and with others to a minimum. Back at the lab, participants completed a post-induction measure of mood to assess how they had felt during the manipulation. In separate rooms, participants completed the Stroop task to measure their level of cognitive control. Participants were debriefed with a probe for suspicion regarding the true intentions of the study.     Results   Manipulation Check for Mood  As with study 1, we sought to confirm whether the mood induction procedure was successful at inducing the desired moods. We again conducted two separate ANOVAs: one on self-reported valence, and one on self-reported arousal. A 2 (valence) x 2 (arousal) between-subjects ANOVA was conducted on self-reported valence. There was a significant main effect of valence condition on self-reported valence, F (1, 112) = 19.34, p < .001, partial η 2 = .15, but no main effect of arousal condition on self-reported valence, F (1, 112) = 0.71, p = .40, partial η 2 = .01. No significant valence x arousal interaction was found, F (1, 112) = 0.01, p = .92, partial η 2 = .00. Thus those in pleasant valence conditions reported more pleasant emotions than those in neutral valence conditions. In contrast, those in the high arousal conditions reported similar levels of pleasant emotions as those who in the low arousal conditions.  A 2 (environment) x 2 (activity level) between-subjects ANOVA was also conducted on self-reported arousal. There was a significant main effect for arousal condition on arousal, F (1,112) = 55.70, p < .001, partial η 2 = .33. There was also a small but significant main effect of valence condition on arousal, F (1,112) = 6.19, p = .01, partial η 2 = .05. No valence x arousal level interaction was found, F (1, 112) = .24, p = .63. partial η 2 = .00. This shows that those in the high arousal conditions reported greater arousal than those in the low arousal conditions. Additionally, people in the pleasant valence conditions also reported higher arousal than people in the neutral valence conditions. Although the valence and arousal conditions both appear to affect arousal, the relatively small effect size for valence condition in this case suggests that the mood induction generally put people into the desired moods.    Effect of Mood on Cognitive Performance  A 2 (valence) x 2 (arousal) ANOVA was conducted on mean Stroop response times. Main effects were not significant for either valence, F (1, 112) = 1.01, p = .38, partial η 2 = .01, or arousal F (1, 112) = .16, p = .69, partial η 2 = .00. No valence x arousal interaction was found F (1, 112) = .85, p = .36, partial η 2 = .01. Mean Stroop RTs are presented in Table 2 .   10.1371/journal.pone.0147275.t002  Table 2  Mean log Stroop response times (RTs) in Study 2.

Although differences in the environment manipulation showed effects on valence only, the activity level showed effects on both valence and arousal. It should be noted, however, that the effect of experiencing different levels of activity on arousal was much larger than the effect on valence. Thus, we are confident that participants across the two studies were experiencing moods close to those that we intended.  Despite generally successful mood inductions, we failed to find any support for our hypotheses that post mood induction Stroop performance would differ by affective valence or arousal. Following this second set of null results we speculated that the discrepancy between our findings and those by Tice et al [ 2 ] may be due to our choice in self-regulation assessments. Tice et al [ 2 ] utilized behavioral measures of self-regulation (drinking unpleasant beverages, persistence on a frustrating or unsolvable task, and physical stamina as measured by the hand grip task) while we employed a cognitive measure of self-regulation (the Stroop task). Therefore, we decided to conduct a third study that employed both cognitive and behavioral assessments of self-regulation.     Study 3  Following unexpected results in studies 1 and 2 we sought to replicate the finding that positive emotion can restore cognitive resources using a similar methodology to that used by Tice et al., [ 2 ]. In study 3 we did not independently manipulate valence and arousal but instead manipulated positive mood with a video clip and assessed ego-depletion with both a measure of physical stamina (the ‘handgrip task’) and the Stroop task.   Method   Participants  Seventy-seven participants were recruited from a university participant pool and were awarded course credit for participating. Fifteen participants were excluded from analysis for procedural issues and failing to follow instructions. Analysis included 62 participants (45 women, 17 men) between the ages of 18 and 35 years old ( M = 19.98, SD = 3.03). Participants were randomly assigned to a condition before arrival (positive n = 32, neutral n = 30). This study was approved by the Carleton University Ethics Committee for Psychological Research. Participants provided written consent to participate in the study.    Procedure  Participants provided written consent, completed demographic and personality questionnaires, and the same depletion task used in studies 1 and 2. A handgrip task was then administered to obtain a baseline measure of stamina while in a depleted state. Following random assignment to condition, participants viewed a ten-minute film clip meant to induce a positive or neutral mood. Participants then completed a brief affect questionnaire followed by a second handgrip task. Finally, participants completed a computer-based Stroop task.     Materials   Background information and personality  Participants completed self-report questionnaires relating to background and personality information similar to those in Studies 1 and 2.    State mood  State mood was measured after the mood induction using a 28-item version of the mood questionnaire [ 16 ].    Handgrip task  The handgrip task measures the duration of time an individual can contract a handgrip (a hand exercise device comprised of two handles and a metal spring) sufficiently tight to hold a small object between the handles. The handgrip task is commonly used in the ego-depletion literature [ 2 ][ 9 ]. Sitting in a chair with their dominant arm on the armrest, participants contracted an Energetics brand handgrip tight enough to hold a 1.2 cm wide eraser between the handles. Using a stopwatch the experimenter timed the duration of time each participant could hold the eraser between the handles of the handgrip.    Mood induction  Mood was induced by one of two ten-minute long films previously demonstrated to induce either a positive or a neutral mood [ 31 ]. A scene from ‘E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial’ that shows children successfully rescuing a young extra-terrestrial from the authorities [ 32 ] was used as the positive mood manipulation. A ten-minute clip from a documentary about a painter [ 33 ] was used as the neutral mood manipulation.     Results   Manipulation Check  A series of independent samples t -tests were employed to assess the effectiveness of the mood induction manipulation. Self-reported valence and arousal were both greater in the positive condition. Specifically, those in the positive condition ( M = 6.15, SD = .72) reported higher levels of affective valence than did those in the neutral mood condition ( M = 5.32, SD = .89), t (60) = 4.05, p < .001, d = . 74 . However, participants in the positive condition ( M = 4.56, SD = 1.20) also reported similarly more affective arousal than participants in the neutral mood condition ( M = 3.28, SD = 1.10), t (60) = 4.38, p < .001, d = .80.    Handgrip  A 2 (Time) x 2 (Condition) mixed ANOVA was conducted on handgrip persistence. Main effects were not significant for Time, F (1, 60) = 3.29, p = .08, η 2 = .05, or Condition, F (1, 60) = 2.714, p = .11, η 2 = .04. The Time x Condition interaction was not significant, F (1, 60) = .227, p = .64, η 2 = .00. Handgrip persistence times are presented in Table 3 .   10.1371/journal.pone.0147275.t003  Table 3  Handgrip persistence times in seconds for Study 3.               Pre  Post    Valence  M  SD  M  SD      Neutral  26.37  23.49  22.03  18.42    Positive  34.84  26.92  32.31  24.47       Because some non-significant effects were of modest size (or ‘marginally significant’), we explored some follow-up tests. Repeated measure t-tests revealed that handgrip times in the neutral mood condition decreased from the first handgrip task ( M = 26.37s, SD = 23.49s) to the second ( M = 22.03s, SD = 18.42s), t (29) = 2.04, p = .05, d = .36, while there was no significant difference in handgrip times in the positive mood condition from the first task ( M = 34.84s, SD = 26.92s) to the second ( M = 32.31s, SD = 24.47s), t (31) = .82, p = .42, d = . 12 . Thus, the pattern of simple effects plausibly support a weak, relative restorative effect of positive moods.    Effect of Mood on Cognitive Performance  Independent t-tests were conducted to compare mean Stroop response times between conditions. The mean Stroop response times for those in the positive mood condition (M = 2.913, SD = .050) did not differ significantly from those in the neutral mood condition (M = 2.929, SD = .047), t(60) = 1.32, p = .19, d = .33.     Discussion  In study 3 we sought to replicate the findings of Tice et al., [ 2 ] by manipulating positive affect and assessing ego-depletion with persistence on a handgrip task, in addition to the Stroop task. We intended to primarily manipulate affective valence, and in this regard the mood manipulation was successful. However, the manipulation also increased affective arousal. Thus, the positive mood manipulation produced high-arousal positive mood.  We observed that, in the neutral condition, participants persisted less on the handgrip task after watching the video clip than they did immediately following the depletion task. The observed effect in the neutral mood condition was small to moderate ( d = .36; [ 34 ]) and on the threshold of conventional standards of statistical significance; however, it indicates that participants gave up on the task more quickly after the neutral mood induction, compared to immediately following depletion. In contrast, handgrip persistence did not differ significantly across time points in the positive mood condition. Thus, participants persisted on the handgrip task for approximately the same duration immediately following depletion as they did following the positive mood induction. In fact, handgrip persistence decreases over the two assessments (although the difference was not significant).  Because the neutral mood induction lead to a within-person decrease in handgrip persistence while the positive mood induction did not, it is possible to interpret these results as supporting a beneficial effect of positive mood on self-regulation. That is, it is plausible that the positive mood induction incubated participants from the detrimental effects observed in the neutral mood condition. However, the lack of within-person improvement in handgrip persistence from a depleted state to a positive mood state also suggests that participants’ self-regulatory abilities did not fully ‘restore’. Therefore, the results of this study do not provide strong evidence for the restorative function of positive mood on self-regulatory abilities.     Study 4  In Studies 1 and 2 we manipulated valence and arousal independently. Although a more elegant approach compared to a single manipulation, those efforts were not rewarded with clear findings. In study 3 we targeted affective valence only as a pragmatic choice to reduce sample size, but the manipulation influenced arousal as well. We made a similar pragmatic choice in study 4 and opted to round out our investigation by focusing our affect manipulation on arousal. That is, we sought to isolate the potential role of arousal in the restorative process by manipulating states of arousal (high vs. low) and assessing within- and between-subjects differences in Stroop performance.   Method   Participants  Sixty-two participants completed the study in exchange for course credit. Three participants were excluded from analysis for either not following instructions ( n = 2) or for color blindness ( n = 1). Analysis included 59 participants (18 male, 40 female, 1 unspecified) between the ages of 18 and 52 ( M = 21.8, SD = 6.57). Participants were randomly assigned to either a low arousal ( n = 35) or high arousal condition ( n = 24). This study was approved by the Carleton University Ethics Committee for Psychological Research. Participants provided written consent to participate in the study.    Procedure  Participants enrolled in a study entitled “personality and cognition” in exchange for course credit. After completing a consent form, demographic questionnaire, and personality measure, participants finished the written ego-depletion task. Following the depletion task, a brief mood assessment was administered. Participants then completed the Stroop task in order to obtain a measure of cognitive control while in a depleted state. Next, participants were randomly assigned to the low or high arousal conditions. In the low arousal condition, participants were asked to sit in their chair and relax for 5 minutes. In the high arousal condition participants completed 4 sets of 30 jumping jacks with one-minute rest periods between each set (the average time for this task took 5 minutes). Following completion of the condition-specific activities, participants completed a mood measure and a second iteration of the Stroop task. Finally, participants were given a verbal and written debriefing.     Materials   Background information and personality  Participants completed demographic and personality questionnaires similar to those used in studies 1–3.    State mood  State mood was assessed with the same measure employed in study 3.    Depletion task  Consistent with the previous studies self-regulatory resources were depleted by asking participants to form and break a habit in a short writing task.    Mood induction  Mood was induced between-subjects so that participants differed in their levels of arousal (high vs. low). Arousal manipulations were selected based on their demonstrated efficacy in previous research [ 35 ]. In the low arousal condition participants sat quietly in an empty room for five minutes. In the high arousal condition participants completed 4 sets of 30 jumping jacks with one-minute rest periods between each set. The task took approximately five minutes to complete.    Cognitive control task  A computer administered Stroop task was again used as a measure of cognitive control. The number of total, congruent, and incongruent trials were identical to those in studies 1–3.     Results   Manipulation check for mood  Following the manipulation, self-reported arousal was significantly higher in the high arousal condition ( M = 5.06, SD = 1.21) than in the low arousal condition ( M = 3.74, SD = .98), t (57) = 4.61, p < .001, d = 1.22. Participants in the high arousal condition ( M = 5.90, SD = .74) also reported slightly more positive affective valence than those in the low arousal condition ( M = 5.43, SD = 1.15); however, this difference was not statistically significant, t (57) = 1.76, p = .08, d = .47.    Effects of mood condition on cognitive performance  A 2 (arousal) x 2 (time) mixed ANOVA was conducted on mean Stroop response times in order to determine whether differences in arousal affected cognitive control following depletion. A significant main effect was found across time points, F (1, 57) = 153.27, p < .001, partial η 2 = .73, indicating that mean response times decreased over time; however, no main effect was found for the arousal condition, F (1, 57) = .01, p = .94, partial η 2 = .00. An arousal condition x time interaction was found, F (1, 57) = 6.77, p = .01, partial η 2 = .09 indicating that the performance increase on the Stroop task from pre-test to post-test was greater for the high arousal condition than the low arousal condition. Stroop RTs are presented in Table 4 .   10.1371/journal.pone.0147275.t004  Table 4  Mean log Stroop response times (RTs) in Study 4.               Pre  Post    Arousal  M  SD  M  SD      Low  2.972  .057  2.937  .049    High  2.982  .073  2.929  .057          Discussion  In study 4 we manipulated high and low states of arousal by varying levels of physical activity. Our manipulation created largely divergent states of arousal between conditions. The high arousal manipulation also seemed to increase levels of affective valence slightly, although the difference in valence was not statistically significant. Thus, the mood manipulation generally produced the intended effects.  As in study 1, we observed decreases in mean Stroop response times across time points, which could indicate practice effects, affect-linked cognitive restoration, or restoration due only to time. However, the presence of a time x arousal interaction suggests that the increase in performance across time points was greater in the high arousal condition than the low arousal condition. Although this effect was small, these results suggest that some restoration did occur, and that high levels of arousal enhanced this effect.     General Discussion  Across four studies, with different mood inductions and both within- and between-persons comparisons, no consistent pattern of results emerged regarding the effect of affective valence or arousal on cognitive restoration in an ego-depletion paradigm. This contrasts with previous research indicating restorative effects on behavioral and cognitive inhibition tasks [ 2 ] [ 36 ].  Our mood inductions were relatively successful at independently manipulating the valence and arousal of mood. In study 1, differences in valence conditions caused differences in self-reported valence but not arousal. Likewise, differences in arousal conditions caused differences in self-reported arousal but not valence. In study 2, the valence manipulation (pleasant environment) produced effects only on affective valence whereas the arousal manipulation (physical activity) had an impact on both arousal and valence. In study 3 we intended to manipulate valence with a video-clip but instead elevated levels of both valence and arousal. Finally, in study 4 we successfully manipulated high vs. low states of arousal although some (statistically non-significant) differences we present in valence. In addition to manipulating valence and arousal relatively independently, our mood inductions created substantial differences in participants’ moods.  After carefully comparing and contrasting our studies with Tice et al.’s studies, the difference in dependent variables (i.e., cognitive vs. behavioral control) seems a plausible explanation for divergent restoration results in studies 1, 2, and 4. Although a plausible pattern of relative restoration could be extracted from the handgrip data in study 3, our results do not provide strong support for the restorative effect of positive mood on behavioral control. It remains plausible that more behavioral (vs. cognitive) forms of self-control are restored by pleasant or aroused affect, but such a pattern seems to also challenge the idea of a shared self-control resource that would also influence cognitive control.  Another consideration is our particular choices of depletion and self-regulation assessment task combinations. A series of recent studies by Wenzel and colleagues [ 36 ] [ 37 ] have found that positive moods benefit self-control performance when the depletion task and self-regulation assessment task are different (i.e. resisting candy vs. Stroop), but moods have no effect in the less demanding context with two of the same tasks (i.e. two Stroop tasks). Instead of drawing upon the strength model of self-control to explain this ‘task-switching’ effect, the authors propose an explanation derived from conflict-monitoring theory [ 38 ]. Conflict-monitoring theory holds that two systems are involved in solving response conflicts: a conflict-monitoring system and a regulatory system. The conflict-monitoring system detects conflicting stimuli (such as incongruent stimuli on the Stroop task) and the regulatory system resolves the conflict and enables the selection of the appropriate response. Wenzel and colleagues propose that the conflict-monitoring system is impaired when the required response in the depletion tasks conflicts with the required response in the self-regulation assessment (the task switching cost). In such cases positive mood enhances performance because positive mood promotes cognitive flexibility (e.g., [ 39 ]). Notably, two experiments [ 36 ] [ 37 ] found this effect of positive affect on self-control using a Stroop task. These findings suggest that our failure to find an effect of positive mood on self-regulation cannot entirely be attributed to using the Stroop task instead of behavioral measures of self-control.  Wenzel et al [ 36 ] have also suggested that the ‘task switching’ effect could explain the findings by Tice et al [ 2 ] because all four studies used dissimilar pairs of depletion and self-control assessment tasks. Although our experiments were not designed to test a task switching effect, it is interesting to note that our depletion tasks were also consistently dissimilar, and yet we did not observe an effect of positive affect. In this way, our results also diverge from Wenzel et al.  We cannot be certain why our efforts to find an effect of positive affect on restoration (or cognitive flexibility) were not successful. However, our results should be interpreted within the current context of the ego-depletion literature. Recently a debate has emerged as to whether the ego-depletion phenomenon exists at all. One meta-analysis [ 18 ] of 198 published studies on the ego-depletion effect concluded that the effect is a robust finding. However, when reanalyzed using the PET/PEESE statistical methods to compensate for small study effects, such as publication bias, the depletion effect was approximately equal to zero [ 7 ]. Other work has revealed problems with the PET/PEESE method, and estimated an attenuated—yet still moderately sized—effect for depletion tasks when using the alternative p-curve method of bias correction [ 40 ]. Vigorous debate on the true effect size continues. In studies 2 and 4 (the only studies including repeated Stroop assessments) we observed substantial improvements in Stroop performance after a 5-minute delay. Although practice effects may account for some improvement, it seems likely that a short break (i.e., during mood inductions) was the primary cause of better performance. Examining the mean RTs across trials, over time, for both tasks reveals a stark and substantial improvement from the end of the first task to the beginning of the second task, rather than the continuous gradual improvement a practice effect would produce. In sum, restoration likely occurred, it just did not depend very much or consistently on affective state.  An important consideration in this unresolved depletion debate is that null and inconsistent findings are often not made available to the research community. Therefore, we feel it is important to report null and inconsistent results as openly as possible. We hope that our raw data (osf.io/ax634/) will be of use to those seeking to understand the role of affect in self-regulation and to ego-depletion research, even if no clear picture has emerged across the four studies we conducted on the topic.   Limitations and Future Research  The present investigation used methods that limit generalizability and conclusions in some potentially important ways. First, we began this research in 2010 with goals to conceptually replicate restoration effects and clarify the potentially distinct roles of valence and arousal. Since then we, like many in Psychology, have learned more about best practices in replication attempts and statistical power. The sample sizes in our research (109, 116, 62, and 59) were generally larger than those collected by Tice et al., [ 2 ] (48, 93, 42, and 26); however, it is likely that both sets of studies were underpowered [ 41 ]. Future research on this topic would benefit from substantially larger sample sizes.  Second, although we strived to manipulate the valence and arousal of emotions independently, these dimensions are interconnected in complex and subtle ways that may be difficult to separate through self-report measures. Thus, the true independent manipulation of each dimension of emotion is likely difficult, if not impossible, and may not encapsulate real mood states as they exist in daily life. Indeed, the independence between arousal and valence are clear only at the conceptual level; the correlation between these dimensions can vary by personality, timeframe, etc. [ 42 ] [ 43 ] [ 44 ]. Additionally, it is noteworthy that the current investigation did not induce extreme mood states and did not include negative emotions. The broad effect of emotional states, both positive and negative, on restoration remains for future investigation. Future research might also benefit by investigating a wider variety of depletion methods and measures, and include more diverse participant samples.  Third, the number of participants excluded from analyses may limit generalizability of the findings in some ways. Cases were excluded largely for failing to complete the depletion task or not following instructions for completing the Stroop task. It is possible that the relatively monotonous procedures of the four studies also played a role in these instances of failing to comply with instructions; this aspect of the experimental design is itself a potential limitation for generalizability to other contexts. That said, we believe that our conclusions about these data are robust across reasonable alternative exclusion criteria, something that could be explored further with our publicly available datasets.  Lastly, because our experimental designs did not include manipulation checks for the depletion task, it is possible that we failed to observe restoration because there was no depletion to restore. Although plausible, this seems unlikely. The ‘crossing out letters’ depletion task used in each of our four studies is commonly used and well validated in depletion research. For example, the same depletion task was found to be effective by Tice et al., [ 2 ]. Additionally, Hagger et al.’s [ 18 ] meta-analysis of ego depletion included 20 studies (with > 1000 participants) that used the same task in this way and found a substantial average effect size of d = .77 (95% CI: .65, .90), and no significant heterogeneity across studies (i.e., non-significant Cochran’s Q). As noted above, our data also suggest a restoration—and thus initial depletion—effect in the two studies that measured Stroop performance over time. Therefore, although we cannot be certain, it seems very likely that our depletion manipulations were successful.  In conclusion, we conducted four studies that investigated the role of affective valence and arousal on restoring cognitive resources following depletion. Our methods included independently manipulating valence and/or arousal (studies 1, 2 & 4), in addition to a more conventional positive mood manipulation (study 3). Across four studies no consistent pattern of results emerged to suggest that affect impacts the rates of cognitive restoration following depletion. Although our manipulations produced substantial differences in affect, the interconnectedness of valence and arousal made independent manipulation somewhat imprecise. In the context of mostly null results, this complexity seems inconsequential. Our findings do not support the conclusions of previous research. Yet, our studies were not highly powered enough to make strong null conclusions. We see the value of this work as prompting questions about the robustness or size of restoration effects, and hope that sharing ambiguous findings will ultimately help move the field towards clarity on hotly debated issues in self-control.

Objective  According to the theory of work craving, a workaholic has a craving for self-worth compensatory incentives and an expectation of relief from negative affect experienced through neurotic perfectionism and an obsessive-compulsive style of working. Research has shown that workaholism and work engagement should be considered as two distinct work styles with different health consequences. However, the mechanisms underlying the adoption of these work styles have been neglected. The present study proposes that work craving and work engagement are differentially associated with self-regulatory competencies and health. In particular, we expected that the working styles mediate the relationships between emotional self-regulation and health. Methods: In the cross-sectional study, 469 teachers from German schools completed online administered questionnaires. By means of structural equation modeling, we tested two indirect paths: a) from self-relaxation deficits via work craving to poor health and b) from self-motivation competencies via work engagement to good health.   Results  As expected, we found evidence that a) the negative relationship of self-relaxation deficits on health was partially mediated by work craving and b) the positive relationship of self-motivation competencies on health was partially mediated by work engagement.   Conclusions  The present study emphasizes the importance of self-regulation competencies for healthy or unhealthy work styles. Whereas work craving was associated with a low ability to down-regulate negative emotions and poor health, work engagement was associated with a high ability to up-regulate positive emotions and good health.

Although some studies have shown negative relationships between workaholism and health [1] , [2] or positive relationships between work engagement and health [3] , [4] , the self-regulatory mechanisms behind these two different work styles have been neglected so far. This research aimed at extending current knowledge in at least three respects. First, our focus on the associations between emotional self-regulation, work styles, and health outcomes enhances an understanding of the role of personal characteristics in the etiology of workaholism and its health consequences. Second, our examination of the mediation between self-regulatory competencies and health underlines the importance of work styles as mechanisms for individual well-being. Finally, our distinction between two work styles (i.e., work craving vs. work engagement) provides a differentiated picture of the relationships between work styles and health.   Workaholism versus Work Engagement  Work engagement has been proven to be an empirically distinct construct from workaholism [5] , [6] . Work engagement is defined as a positive, fullfilling, work-related state of mind characterized by vigor (energy, concentration, strain, persistence in the face of inconviniencies), dedication (inspiration and challenge, full of work enthusiasm) and absorption (like an enduring flow-experience) [7] . Although the concept of work engagement was clearly defined, the concept of workaholism remained vague because of two reasons. First, work engagement is still considered by some scholars as a possible dimension of workaholism (e.g., [8] ). Second, recent conceptualisations of workaholism propose obsessive inner drive as the core characteristic of workaholism and neglect its addictive nature (e.g., [7] ). To avoid the vagueness of the concept of “workaholism”, we explicitly differentiate between work engagement and work addiction. Thus, in the present study, we adopted the conceptualization of workaholism as work craving [9] , [10] .  Wojdylo [9] proposed the theory of work addiction, which she called work craving. She argued that the core characteristics of work addiction are not fully explained by obsessive inner drive but constitute other addictive mechanisms. In her view, a main mechanism of work addiction is the compensatory function of emotions, which explains the inner obsessive drive of workaholics in fulfilling unrealistic standards of perfectionism. Thus, in contrast to previous theories of workaholism (e.g. [11] , [7] , [8] ), the conceptualization of work craving constitutes a synthesis of obsessive-compulsive and addictive elements. Specifically, in addition to the compulsive/behavioral component, work craving theory includes two hedonic/affective components (anticipation of self-worth compensation and anticipation of reduction of negative affect or withdrawal symptoms resulting from working), and a learning component (neurotic perfectionism) [9] , [10] . Thus, work craving is defined as an emotional-motivational state oriented at compensation of negative emotions through an obsessive-compulsive work style and a desire for unrealistic (neurotic) perfectionistic standards.  Studies have shown that work engagement and workaholism have distinct regulatory mechanisms and outcomes. Workaholism and work engagement share the behavioral component (working excessively hard, high work involvement), but the emotional and motivational aspects of these phenomena differ fundamentally. Whereas workaholics are motivated by an obsessive inner drive they cannot resist, engaged employees are intrinsically motivated, have a sense of energetic and effective connection with their work activities, and view themselves as able to deal well with the demands of their jobs [12] . These findings imply that workaholism and work engagement are differently related with self-regulation competencies (i.e., self-relaxation and self-motivation). According to work craving theory, the emotion-regulatory components inherent in work craving (i.e., anticipation of reduction of negative emotions and desire for self-worth compensatory incentives) imply that work craving should derive from low rather than high self-regulatory competencies [10] .  As mentioned above, studies have also shown that workaholism and work engagement are related with distinct outcomes. Work engagement is related to desirable outcomes like job and life satisfaction, better job performance and negatively associated with ill being [13] , [14] ). Workaholism, in contrast, is related to negative outcomes like psychosomatic symptoms, mental and physical health complaints [15] , [2] , [16] , [14] , [10] , poor emotional well-being [17] , increased work-family conflict [18] , and low life satisfaction [19] , [20] ). In the present study, we therefore expected work craving to be negatively associated with health ( H1a ) and work engagement to be positively associated with health ( H1b ).   Emotional Self-Regulation and Well-Being  The ability to self-regulate one's feelings and thoughts plays an important role in personality functioning [21] , [22] and can be differentiated into two major self-regulation competencies: self-relaxation and self-motivation [23] , [24] , [25] . Individual differences in self-relaxation and self-motivation competencies can be assessed by the failure- and decision-related action control scales, respectively [26] . In these scales, high levels of self-regulation competencies are called action orientation whereas low levels are called state orientation and indicate a low action orientation.  Failure-related action orientation (AOF) is the ability to reduce the negative affect during or after confrontation with failure or threat (high self-relaxation) and to keep up or even enhance access to the self (i.e., implicit representations of own wishes, goals, and preferences). Thus, it promotes the formation of realistic and self-congruent goals and, in turn, well-being especially under threatening conditions (e.g., [27] , [28] , [29] ). In contrast, failure-related state orientation (the low end of the AOF scale) denotes a low ability to self-regulate negative affect (low self-relaxation) and is characterized by ruminative thoughts. Studies found relationships between failure-related state orientation and psychosomatic symptoms, depression, low self-esteem, and self-consciousness [27] , [30] , [31] as well as workaholism [32] .  Decision-related action orientation (AOD) is the ability to up-regulate positive affect, to overcome feelings of listlessness, and to foster confidence and enthusiasm despite the presence of challenging demands and difficulties (high self-motivation). Thus, it is a decisive precondition for an efficient translation of intentions into action. In contrast, decision-related state orientation (the low end of the AOD scale) denotes a low ability to self-generate positive affect (low self-motivation) and it characterized by hesitation. Studies have linked decision-related state orientation to reduced well-being [27] , a low ability to behave according to one's preferences [33] , procrastination [34] and workaholism [32] .  Hence, we hypothesize that self-relaxation and self- motivation competencies are negatively associated with work craving ( H2a ) and positively with work engagement ( H2b ). Furthermore, we hypothesize that self-relaxation and self-motivation competencies are positively related with health indices ( H3 ). Finally, we consider work styles as mediators between self-regulation competencies and health. Despite the correlational nature of many of the reviewed findings, self-regulation competencies are better conceived of as antecedents rather than consequences of work styles and health because failure- and decision-related action orientation are personality dispositions that develop during early childhood and are rather stable over time [25] , [26] . In addition, longitudinal findings indicate that work styles precede rather than follow from health states [14] . We hypothesize that the relationship between self-relaxation and self-motivation competencies and good health is partially mediated by work engagement ( H4a ), and that the relationship between self-relaxation deficits and self-motivation deficits and poor health is partially mediated by work craving ( H4b ).   Work Craving, Work Engagement, and Working Hours  According to the view of lay people, working a lot can be equated to workaholism. From our point of view, working hours and workaholism have to be separated. Wojdylo et al. [10] empirically showed that work cravers and work engagers did indeed work an equal number of hours. Thus, differences between work craving and work engagement cannot be attributed to different hours of working but, instead, to different work styles alone. We aspired to replicate these findings, so we also explored the relationship between working hours and the two different work styles of work craving and work engagement. We hypothesize that the relationship between work craving and number of worked hours is low ( H5 ).   Method  We decided to conduct our study in a sample of German school-teachers for two reasons. First, differences between state- and action-oriented individuals are typically observed under demanding conditions. We expected the workplace of teachers to be sufficiently demanding to necessitate the use of self-regulation competencies (because of high stress conditions and emotional demands) and, therefore, to observe a benefit of action orientation. Second, because of the high work-related stress, burnout rates, and mental health problems among teachers in Germany [35] , we also expected to find sufficient levels of health complaints and unhealthy work style. When testing at schools in Germany, we needed to go through an ethical board of the respective federal state coordinating assessments at schools (ADD: Aufsichts- und Dienstleistungsdirektion). The ADD of the federal state of Rheinland-Pfalz approved our study (ADD approval 51 111-31/129-12). In addition, the representative for data security approved our study (see attachment: Approval 6.08.22.001:0363). Participants were given detailed information about their rights and gave their informed consent through participation in the study. Participants have provided their written informed consent to participate in this study. Only data from participants were used who fully completed the study and did not send an e-mail to the study coordinator to refrain from the study.   Participants  The present study is a part of the Work Craving International Project (WCIP), a large cohort research realized in Poland and Germany (“Work craving – personality antecedents and regulatory mechanisms”). The WCIP aims at examining the new conceptualization of workaholism as work craving and its personality mechanisms [10] .  Four hundred and sixty-nine teachers from the Federal State Rheinland-Pfalz of Germany participated in the present study (345 women and 121 men, 3 participants gave no information on gender). Participants were recruited via e-mail to all school principals across Rheinland-Pfalz. The principles were asked to distribute the information among the staff. Participants completed the questionnaire voluntarily online which took about 45 minutes. Participants' average age was 45 years (SD  =  10.57), with a range of 21 to 64 years. 62.5 % were married, 20.5 % were living in a relationship, 14.9 % were living alone, and 1.9 % did not provide information about their marital status. 36.7 % were teaching in primary schools, 14.7 % in secondary/graduate schools, 16.2 % in special schools, 15.6 % in vocational schools, and 16.8% in other school forms. 63.1 % were employed full-time, 17.3 % worked 30 hours a week, 11.7 % were employed part-time, 6 % worked less than part-time, and 1.9 % did not give information regarding their employment.   Measures and Procedure  All questionnaires were administered online in a German version.   Work engagement  The Utrecht Work Engagement Scale (UWES, [36] ) was used. The UWES consists of 17 items and has three subscales: Vigor ( “At my work, I feel bursting with energy” ), dedication, ( “I find the work that I do full of meaning and purpose” ), and absorption ( “When I am working, I forget everything else around me” ). Items were scored by means of a 7-point frequency rating scale ranging from 0 (never) to 6 (each day). We considered higher general scores as an indicator of higher work engagement. The internal consistency (Cronbach's Alpha) of the UWES was α  = .90.   Work craving  The German version of 28-item Work Craving Scale (WCS, [10] ) was used to assess workaholism. The WCS has four subscales (7 items each): Obsessive-compulsive desire for work ( “I have an urge to work more and more” ), anticipation of self-worth compensatory incentives from work ( “Overworking makes me feel important” ), anticipation of reduction of negative affect and withdrawal symptoms ( “Working now would bring me a relief” ), and neurotic perfectionism ( “Even though I perform a task very carefully, I feel that it is done not correctly enough” ). Items were scored by means of a 7-point agreement rating scale ranging from 1 (not at all) to 7 (completely). In our study, higher general scores were taken to indicate higher work craving (α  = .95).   Emotional self-regulation  Self-regulation competencies were assessed by the Action Control Scale (ACS, [37] ). The failure-related dimension of action orientation (AOF) was used to assess the ability to down-regulate negative affect following a failure, thus self-relaxation. An example item for AOF is “I've worked for weeks on one project and then everything goes completely wrong: (a) It takes me a long time to get over it, or (b) It bothers me for a while, but then I don't think about it anymore” . The decision-related dimension of action orientation (AOD) was used to assess the ability to up-regulate positive affect preceding an action, thus self-motivation. An example item for AOD is “ When I am getting ready to tackle a difficult problem: (a) It feels like I am facing a big mountain that I don't think I can climb,or (b) I look for a way that the problem can be approached in a suitable manner.” In the example items, options ""a"" reflect the state-oriented response alternatives and options ""b"" the action-oriented response alternatives. Each dimension of the scale consists of 12 items. For each dimension, the action-oriented response alternatives were summed so that each scale ranged from 0 to 12, with lower scores indicating lower action orientation (i.e. state orientation) and higher scores indicating higher action orientation. For the AOF dimension α  = .84 and for the AOD dimension α  = .87.   General health  The General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-28, [38] ) was used to assess the mental health status. The GHQ has four subscales: Somatic symptoms ( “Have you recently felt that you are ill?” ), anxiety and insomnia ( “Have you recently lost much sleep over worry?” ), social dysfunction ( “Have you recently been taking longer over the things you do?” ), and severe depression ( “Have you recently felt that life is not worth living?” ) with 7-items each. All 28 items were rated on four-point scales from 1 to 4 with slightly different labels across items. Items' polarity was reversed so that higher GHQ values correspond to better general mental health. In the following analyses, only a general score was considered (α  = .94).   Working hours  Spent working hours was assessed by one item. Participants were asked to estimate the average daily hours they spend working: “How many hours do you actually work on an average day?”   Results   Descriptives and correlations  Table 1 presents an overview of the descriptive results and correlations for the study variables. As expected, work craving correlated negatively ( H1a ) and work engagement positively with health ( H1b ). Second, self-regulatory competencies (AOF and AOD) correlated negatively with work craving ( H2a ) and positively with work engagement ( H2b ). Third, self-relaxation (AOF) and self-motivation (AOD) showed significantly positive correlations with health ( H3 ) and with each other. Contrary to previous findings [10] , there was a significant relationship between work craving and working hours, but the relationship was very weak ( r  = .10) indicating that work craving cannot be inferred from working hours ( H5 ). Finally, in compliance with previous findings [10] , the correlation between work engagement and work craving was very small indicating that they are distinct work styles.  10.1371/journal.pone.0106379.t001 Table 1  Descriptives and Bivariate Correlations (Pearson) Between Study Variables (N  =  469).

Structural equation modeling  To further test our hypotheses regarding meditational effects ( H4a and H4b ), we used structural equation modeling (SEM). We designed a path-model ( Figure 1 , Model A) allowing us to test the four mediation assumptions at the same time: that work craving mediates between self-relaxation deficits and poor health and between self-motivation deficits and poor health whereas work engagement mediates between self-relaxation competencies and good health and between self-motivation competencies and good health. The Model Fit was estimated by means of Mplus6 [39] . The regression coefficients were adjoined to the hypothetical Model A in Figure 1 . For Model A, good fit indices were achieved (CFI  = .96; SRMR  = .04; χ 2 (1)  =  17.997). The cut off ranges for the absolute fit indices were achieved (cf. [40] , [41] ). Looking at the path coefficients of Model A, work craving was associated with lower general health whereas AOD, AOF, and work engagement were associated with higher general health. Most important for our theoretical expectations, only the paths from AOF to work craving and from AOD to work engagement were significant, whereas the paths from AOF to work engagement and from AOD to work craving were low and not significant.  10.1371/journal.pone.0106379.g001 Figure 1  Regression coefficients of two path models tested through structural equation modeling.

For each observed variable, R 2  =  (1 - error variance). * p <.05 *** p <.001.   According to these results, we tested an alternative model ( Figure 1 , Model B) with only two indirect paths at the same time: that work craving mediates between self-relaxation deficits and poor health whereas work engagement mediates between self-motivation competencies and good health. Model B reached with a CFI  = .997, SRMR  = .019, and χ 2 (2)  =  3.27 a generally good fit. We found significant direct effects from AOF and AOD on health ( β AOF  = .20, p <.01; β AOD  = .11, p <.01). Consistent with expectations, we also found significant indirect effects from AOF through work craving on health ( H4a : β AOF_WCS  =  -.19, p <.05) and from AOD through work engagement on health ( H4b : β AOD_UWES  =  −.08, p <.05).  When comparing the model fit of the competing models A and B, Model B reached a better fit. According to the chi square difference test, the difference between the models was significant (Δχ 2 (1)  =  14.72, p <.001. The findings indicated that the relationship between self-relaxation deficits (but not by self-motivation deficits) and poor health was partially mediated by work craving whereas the relationship between self-motivation competencies (but not self-relaxation competencies) and good health was partially mediated by work engagement.   Discussion  The aim of the present paper was to understand more precisely the differences between work craving and work engagement, their regulatory mechanisms, and outcomes. Our study showed that work cravers have low abilities in self-relaxation as well as low abilities in self-motivation, whereas work engagers have high self-regulatory abilities of both types. These findings are consistent with and extent findings regarding motivational differences between workaholics and engaged employees. Van Beek, Hu, Schaufeli, Taris, and Schreurs [42] , for example, found that workaholic employees feel motivated by instrumental values and tend to introject goals whereas engaged employees work not just for the instrumental value, but also value the work itself and integrate goals into the self (see also: [43] ). These motivational differences can be explained by the presently observed differences in self-regulation competencies between work cravers and work engagers. According to Kuhl [24] , [25] self-regulation competencies form the basis for the creation of realistic, self-congruent goals and self-determination [27] , [28] , [29] . Thus, motivational differences between workaholics (motivated by introjected goals) and work engagers (motivated by integrated goals) can be explained by self-regulatory deficits and self-regulatory competencies. This notion, of course, requires father exploration in the next study.  The present study supported our assumption that work craving and work engagement are partial mediators between self-regulatory competencies and health symptoms. Interestingly, although both types of self-regulatory abilities were associated with more healthy and less unhealthy work styles, results indicated distinct mediating roles of work engagement and work craving. High work craving partially mediated the relationship between self-relaxation deficits (but not self-motivation deficits) and poor health whereas high work engagement partially mediated the relationship between self-motivation competencies (but not self-relaxation competencies) and good health.  Work craving, on the one hand, was fueled in our study in particular by a low ability to self-regulate negative emotions (low self-relaxation). This finding is consistent with Kuhl's [25] , [44] theorizing that overworking may be a coping strategy that suppresses negative feelings without truly self-regulating them. Work cravers' self-relaxation deficits indicate reduced access to the self that might express itself in their tendency to set unrealistically high standards of achievement. Because workaholics do not completely lack self-motivation and/or use external sources of motivation (cf. [42] ), they are able to become initiative and strive for their overly high standards of excellence. Unreachable standards keep them busy and distracted from negative feelings. However, distraction through overworking does not solve any problems or promote success because workaholics' goals are unrealistically high [45] and introjected rather than integrated into the self [42] , [43] . Thus, work craving may instigate a vicious “loss-of-autonomy” cycle [33] in which the self is suppressed, conflict accumulated, effortful control increased, and the self even further suppressed.  Work engagement, on the other hand, was associated in our study in particular with a high ability to self-regulate positive emotions (high self-motivation). Work engagers' high self-motivation competencies make it easier to bring up the positive affect needed to translate an intention into action and contribute to an identification with their goals [42] . They know how they can please themselves and savor the immediate hedonic affect inherent in working. In an experience sampling study by Bledow, Schmitt, Frese, and Kühnel [46] , work engagement was strongest among employees who had a negative onset and managed to shift to a positive mood throughout their working day. Consistent with our findings, these affective shifts were supported by personal resources (i.e., dispositional affectivity) related to high positive rather than low negative affect. Our findings extent the work by Bledow et al. [46] by showing that personal resources for work engagement are not restricted to affect sensitivity (i.e., how easily one enters an emotional state) but also available at the level of affect regulation (i.e., how easily one leaves and actively changes an emotional state once it is aroused) [23] . This is informative because people's affect sensitivity is more genetically predisposed and less malleable through training than their affect regulation competencies (cf. [25] ).  To summarize, the present results revealed that work craving and work engagement have distinct self-regulatory underpinnings and opposing effects on health. Despite the high correlation, self-relaxation and self-motivation competencies show functional dissociations: whereas self-relaxation competencies obviate work craving, self-motivation competencies abet work engagement. These specific effects on two distinct work styles are part of the reasons why self-relaxation and self-motivation contribute to employees' general health.  Furthermore, in earlier research on workaholism, hard workers who worked long hours while experiencing an inner drive were branded workaholics. For a long time, workaholism was defined and measured as excessive working, that is, by quantity (e.g., [47] ). Our results replicated the finding by Wojdylo et al. [10] that work craving is only weakly correlated with and cannot be reduced to spending more time at work.   Limitations and Future Perspectives  The main limitation of the current study is its cross-sectional nature that precludes cause–effect relationships being uncovered. Emotional self-regulation competencies are usually considered as relative stable personality dispositions that develop in early childhood [24] , [25] . Therefore, it is unlikely that the scores on our self-regulation measures are caused by work craving/work engagement or health. In contrast, the causal direction of the association between health and work craving/work engagement is less clear. Although previous research longitudinally established that high workaholism preceded poor health and high work engagement preceded good health [14] , we cannot exclude the possibility that unhealthy workers display more workaholic behaviors and healthy workers display more enthusiastic behaviors. These notions can only be tested adequately using a longitudinal design.  Second, the current data set was drawn from a very specific group of workers (i.e., teachers). Although this particular group has frequently been assumed to be a high-risk group for health problems [48] , [49] , it should be noted that the fact that all participants belonged to this high-risk group could well have led to a restriction in the variance of the study variables. The unique nature of the present sample underlines the need to replicate the current findings on samples of workers from different occupations.  Third, in the present studies, only self-reports were used to measure the constructs. Thus, we cannot preclude an impact of social desirability on the data. For instance, respondents could try to minimize or maximize their problems by under- or over-reporting the severity and the frequency of symptoms. Workaholics might also deny their condition in the same way as people suffering from alcoholism deny drinking. Thus, our present findings should be validated with more objective measures or with additional ratings from family members regarding criteria for work craving.   Practical Implications  As for the practical implications of the present study, it is informative to see that not only current motivational states such as controlled/autonomous motivation [43] or introjected/identified motivation (cf. [42] ) but also individual differences in the ability to self-regulate emotions (i.e., action vs. state orientation) are strongly associated with workaholism and work engagement. The role of self-regulation in the etiology of work craving/work engagement has received less attention than would be warranted when considering the strength of the relationships. Especially a lack of self-relaxation was strongly associated with work craving, suggesting that the concepts of self-regulatory competencies may be a good starting point for interventions at the individual and organizational level to prevent and to treat workaholism. The theory and findings on self-regulation can help to further understand the causes of workaholic behavior, while psychotherapeutic techniques - especially those focused on working with emotions, like emotion-focused therapy [50] , introvision methods [51] , or schema-focused therapy [52] - may be used in assisting workaholic clients to overcome their self-regulatory deficits and internal conflicts.  In conclusion, the present findings may contribute to the development of effective interventions that may help people suffering from work craving to reduce their tendency to “live to work” and promote their ability to “love to work”. The fact that work craving and work engagement exhibit different patterns of possible causes and consequences implies that different intervention strategies should be used when work craving is to be reduced or work engagement is to be enhanced.

Impulsivity has been shown to be associated to addictive behaviors, also to IA, and that the purpose of the study is to investigate whether or not there are variables modulating the relation between impulsivity and IA. “Meaning in life” is regarded as a desirable attribute, with positive mental health outcomes. “Self-esteem” is often regarded as an important component of psychological health which has relation to IA. Therefore, we examined meaning in life and self-esteem’s possible effects in this relationship. A total of 1068 Chinese college students ranging in age from 18 to 25 years were recruited for this cross-sectional survey study. Correlations and multivariate regressions were used to calculate the possible mediation and moderation relationship among the variables of meaning in life, self-esteem, impulsivity, and IA. In the analyses that we conducted, IA was shown to be prevalent among Chinese university students. The relationship between impulsivity and IA was partially mediated by meaning in life, and the relationship between meaning in life and IA was moderated by self-esteem. Our findings demonstrate that meaning in life and self-esteem can be useful buffers to IA for highly impulsive individuals. Further randomized trials to confirm these results are needed.

College students, who are at a critical developmental stage, warrant examination in this respect, because each has a laptop which initially facilitates academic activities, but later is available for recreational activities. Addiction to the internet is becoming a serious mental health issue and strongly impacts academic performance in college samples [ 1 , 2 ]. Internet addiction (IA), appears to be a relatively common behavioral addiction, has certain symptoms and will undergo the same consequences brought about by addiction to alcohol and drugs as well as other obsessive behaviors [ 3 ]. Understanding how college students resist or fail to resist this temptation might shed light on internet addiction. Much research has been conducted in the account for what result in or follows from internet addiction, such as decision making, shyness, social anxiety, depression, conflictual family relations [ 4 – 7 ], and prefrontal control, dysfunctional inhibitory control, impulsivity [ 8 , 9 ].  Impulsive individuals have problems in managing their behavior. Some core indicators of behavioral addiction are identical to those of chemical or substance addiction [ 10 ]. Behavioral addiction, such as IA criteria are presented firstly is recurrent failure to resist impulses to engage in a specified behavior [ 11 ], and a feeling of lack of control while engaging in the behavior. A large body of the literature in this area concerns impulsiveness impacting the addictive tendencies [ 12 – 14 ]. Both behavioral and substance addictions are marked by an inability to stop. One of the most valid methods of intervening those addictions is by identifying and reducing the negative catalysts and strengthening the positive aspects. This pertains much to high impulsivity in addicts, also to internet addiction [ 15 ]. As impulsivity might not be greatly decreased by psychotherapeutic intervention [ 16 , 17 ], other psychological variables may instead be more effective in reducing it. Perhaps impulsive individuals might also possess protective qualities that control them from becoming preoccupied with the internet. We sought to investigate whether or not there are variables modulating the relation between impulsivity and IA, and furthermore, to address the psychological strengths that predict one’s ability to resist the constant allure of the internet. To this end, we examined two complementary mental strengths in resisting IA: meaning in life, and self-esteem.  What kinds of psychological features do people have when they are overly involved in use of the internet? Meaning in life is found to have a stronger positive association with psychological well-being [ 18 , 19 ]. Meaning in life as an association between psychosocial well-being and internet addiction has received much more attention and consistent empirical support [ 20 , 21 ]. Meaning in life is typically referred to as a sense of purpose in one’s life and an accompanying sense of fulfillment [ 22 , 23 ]. It is a desirable attribute in the realm of attitude evaluation. When they confront temptation, they have control over the outcomes, affecting them in important ways. Finding meaning in life means that people feel positive and efficacious, as a psychological strength [ 22 , 24 ].  An decreased level of meaning in life has been correlated with several substantial addictive behaviors among individuals [ 25 ]. Meaning in life plays important role in treating people with alcoholism use [ 26 ]. Meaninglessness in life sometimes brings about a mediating effect on adolescents’ life events and substance used among it [ 27 ]. Having a weaker sense of meaning and purpose in life results in an increased proneness to boredom and empty life [ 28 , 29 ]. Meaningfulness is a cognitive model of empowerment as the basis for worker empowerment [ 30 ]. Boredom was common trigger of intensive internet use [ 31 ]. This in turn, might increase the probability of internet addiction, especially for students at universities where surfing the internet is relatively easy and socially accepted. Consequently, it is important to determine whether meaning in life provides a buffer against addictive behavior in college students.  The essence of human motivation is the “will to meaning” [ 32 ], and a sense of meaning as a cognitive factor has been identified as a potential protective component for individuals [ 33 ]. Thus, while purpose or meaning in life confers benefits for enjoyment of work and positive life attitudes, what happens when people are confronted with the constant allure of the internet? Perhaps meaning in life only provides resiliency when individuals also possess characteristics that allow them to resist hedonism. Self-esteem may be such a characteristic. It may complement meaning in life to confer resistance to IA.  Self-esteem is a psychological strength reflecting one’s overall evaluation of oneself. High self-esteem is often regarded as an important component of psychological health [ 34 , 35 ]. There is some debate over whether self-esteem is more trait-like or state-like [ 36 ]. For the purposes of our study, we considered self-esteem as a stable trait factor because we used an adult sample [ 37 ]. Given self-esteem’s broad implications, it seems a distinct possibility that high self-esteem impacts the pursuit of long-term goals with well-anchored, positive attitudes about the self and happiness [ 38 ]. A close relationship has been documented between low self-esteem and problems such as alcoholism, drug abuse, eating disorders, school dropouts, poor academic performance, pregnancy in adolescence [ 39 – 42 ].  There are several studies on the relevance of self-esteem to internet addiction [ 43 , 44 ]. One study found that emotional support from both parents would increase their child’s self-esteem, which in turn would reduce the child’s risk of being addicted to the internet [ 45 ]. Additionally, research has shown that self-esteem is one of the main antecedents of IA [ 46 ]. Individuals with lower self-esteem are more likely to be addicted to the internet [ 47 , 48 ].  Further, there are several reasons why high self-esteem may be a source of resiliency. First, compatible with theories of self-esteem’s evaluation function and emotional experience [ 49 ], “high self-esteem” individuals are more likely to evaluate themselves as having positive self-esteem and self-competence. Individuals with positive self-value could generate and strengthen their degree of meaning in life. Though these people are lured by the internet as much as others, they may be more likely to maintain or promote their efforts toward attaining meaningful goals instead of aborting them. Second, some studies support the buffer hypothesis, that high self-esteem enhances initiative and pleasant feelings [ 50 , 51 ]. “High self-esteem” confers personal ability and value, so it may serve as a positive factor against addiction which allows individuals to create and realize life goals and purpose in life. One of self-esteem psychological structure just is meaning in life [ 52 ]. In combination, the variables of meaning in life and self-esteem might confer optimal protection from internet addiction. The meaningful pursuits of “high self-esteem” individuals allow them to bridge the gap between their real and ideal selves.    Purpose of the Present Study  In this study, we examined the influences of meaning in life and self-esteem on internet addiction. We argue that meaning in life and self-esteem, each account for impulsivity individual addictive behavior to some degree. To date, the hypothesis that self-esteem moderates the relationship between meaning in life and internet addiction has not been tested. This is the first study to test a synergistic effect between a life attitude (meaning in life) and a self attitude (self-esteem) for a more sophisticated model of resiliency. As mentioned previously, we hypothesized that (H 1 ) meaning in life mediated the relationship between impulsivity and internet addiction. Based on theoretical models of why people indulge in the internet [ 45 , 50 ], we hypothesized that (H 2 ) the relationship between meaning in life and internet addiction is moderated by self-esteem. This allowed a test of construct specificity to IA under more constricted methodological factors.    Methods   Ethics Statement  This study was a cross-sectional survey, and data collection occurred within the context of a larger lecture on mental health. The research was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB), School of Public Health, Jilin University, China. All participants gave written informed consent, and were ensured complete anonymity. Participation was voluntary, and students were given information about campus mental health resources upon completing the study.    Participants  We tested our hypotheses on a large random sample of college students ( N = 1537). All participants were students of medical disciplines at three colleges in North China. They completed self-report measures in the classroom after a formal lecture. A total of 1068 eligible participants (61.1% female; mean age = 22.76, SD = 2.54, range 18–25) responded to the present study. The participation response rate was 69.5%. This rate is similar to those of previous studies [ 53 , 54 ]. There were no significant interactions with gender and socioeconomic status ( p > .05), so these factors were not included in further analyses.    Questionnaires  Participants completed paper-and-pencil self-report questionnaire packets and measures of demographic information, impulsivity (BIS-11), meaning in life (PIL), self-esteem (RSE), and internet addiction (YDQ).  IA was computed from responses on a widely-used eight-item Internet Addiction Diagnostic Questionnaire (YDQ). The YDQ pertains to all types of online activity and has no time limit. Respondents who answered yes to five or more of the eight criteria were classified as addicted internet users [ 55 ]. We considered lower general scores as an indicator of higher IA. The YDQ has been deemed valid and reliable in previous research reports [ 56 ].  Impulsivity was measured using the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale 11 (BIS-11). The BIS-11 is a questionnaire on which participants rate their frequency of several common impulsive or nonimpulsive behaviors/traits on a scale from 1 (rarely/never) to 4 (almost always/always). The questionnaire consists of thirty items, the minimum score is 30, and the maximum is 120; with higher scores indicating greater impulsivity. Its reliability and validity have been shown to be acceptable [ 57 ].  Meaning in life was measured with the widely used Purpose in Life Test (PIL) [ 58 ], an attitude scale which includes twenty ratings made on a 7-point scale, where a “1” indicates low purpose and a “7” indicates high purpose, the minimum score is 20, and the maximum is 140. The PIL provides participants with unique anchors for each item. Some of these anchors are bipolar, some are unipolar, and some utilize a continuum. For example, one item provides a continuum on which one end is “If I could choose, I would prefer never to have been born.” On the other end of the continuum is “If I could choose I would live nine more lives just like this one.” The scale has generally demonstrated good internal consistency [ 18 ].  The Rosenberg Self-Esteem scale (RSE) was used to measure overall feelings of self value and self acceptance [ 59 ]. Participants rated their level of agreement with ten statements on a 5-point Likert-type scale ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). Sample items include, “I feel that I have a number of good qualities,” and “All in all, I am inclined to feel that I’m a failure.” The minimum score is 10, and the maximum is 40. Scores were computed by averaging the items, with higher scores indicating higher self-esteem. This instrument is a well-validated and reliable measure of global self-esteem [ 60 ].     Statistical Analysis   Preliminary analyses  Analysis of the data from this study was performed using SPSS 21.0 statistical software (SPSS, IBM, Lmd, Beijing, China). Missing values in the data were computed along with the sample means. Internet addicts in the general population have a relatively low base-rate occurrence and we found evidence of negative skewness in our sample (skewed = -1.461, SE = .075). Due to a large sample size ( N = 1068), all variables were sufficiently normally distributed [ 61 ]. Bivariate scatter plots showed linear relationships between all variables, and we used stepwise linear regression analyses. Significance values were set at p < .05. Correlations were calculated between the variables of self-esteem, meaning in life, impulsivity, and internet addiction. Values for Cronbach’s alpha are reported in Table 1 .   10.1371/journal.pone.0131597.t001  Table 1  Means, standard deviations, intercorrelations, and internal consistency between study variables.               1  2  3  4      1 Internet addiction  —       2 Impulsivity  -.781 **  —      3 Meaning in life  .846 **  -.751 **  —     4 Self esteem  .723 **  -.546 **  .647 **  —    M  14.58  71.19  94.84  28.90    SD  1.742  9.802  13.617  4.131    α coefficient  0.730  0.787  0.795  0.789       Note: N = 1068;  ** p < 0.01.      Mediation and moderation analyses  As outlined in the Introduction, we conducted a specific mediation and a specific moderation hypothesis. As shown in Fig 1 , we tested the extent to which the relationship between impulsivity and internet addiction is mediated by meaning in life, as well as the extent to which the relationship between meaning in life and internet addiction is moderated by self-esteem. To this end, we tested mediation by finding four regression coefficients: the total effect of impulsivity on internet addiction (c), the direct effect of impulsivity on internet addiction (c'), the effect of impulsivity on meaning in life (a), and the effect of meaning in life on internet addiction (b). When a, b, and c effects are significant, but the c' effect is not significant, a total mediation effect is shown. When a, b, c and c' effects are all significant, a partial mediation effect exists.   10.1371/journal.pone.0131597.g001  Fig 1   The conceptual framework.     Next, we tested moderation effects by implementing the hierarchical regression technique. In the first regression, internet addiction was regressed on impulsivity and self-esteem. The coefficient for impulsivity was significant. In the second regression, meaning in life was regressed on impulsivity and self-esteem. The coefficient for impulsivity was significant here too. In the third regression, internet addiction was regressed on all predictor variables (impulsivity, self-esteem, and meaning in life), and the coefficient for meaning in life was significant. In the final step, internet addiction was regressed on impulsivity, self-esteem, and meaning in life, and the interaction between meaning in life and self-esteem. If the coefficient for the interaction between meaning in life and self-esteem is significant, moderated mediation has occurred [ 62 – 66 ].  Last, an interaction term was created by centering meaning in life and self-esteem around their grand means, and then multiplying them to avoid issues of collinearity with the interaction term. The main effects of meaning in life and self-esteem that is reported are the centered variables. The means and standard deviations reported are from the uncentered variables [ 67 , 68 ]. Next, multiple regressions were conducted. Meaning in life (main effect) and self-esteem (main effect), were entered in Block 1 of the regression analysis while the interaction term (meaning in life × self-esteem) was entered in Block 2 when predicting internet addiction. If the interaction term significantly predicts internet addiction, a moderation effect has been found. To interpret the moderation effect, the data were entered into the regression equation based on high (1 SD above) and low (1 SD below) values of the moderator and mediator variables. In addition, a post-hoc probing of the interaction was conducted using two new conditional interaction terms (high and low) [ 69 ]. This was done to determine if the slopes of the regression equations for high and low values of the interaction differed from zero.     Results   Descriptive statistics  Table 1 displays the means, standard deviations, and correlations between study variables. All variables were significantly and positively correlated in the expected direction. The results indicate excellent reliability for the YDQ, BIS-11, PIL, and RSE questionnaires. Approximately 7.6% of the sample manifested clinically relevant levels of internet addiction. These rates are comparable to, and even above what might be expected. A recent cohort study of college students indicated that 74.5% were moderate users, 24.8% were possible addicts, and 0.7% were addicts [ 70 ]. Variance inflation factors of all predictor variables included in the regression analysis varied between 1.0 and 2.2, indicating that multi-collinearity between predictor variables did not bias our results.    Mediation of meaning in life between impulsivity and internet addiction  Table 2 shows the results of the three separate regression analyses testing the mediation hypothesis. In step 1, a significant effect of impulsivity on internet addiction resulted ( b = -.139, p < .001). In step 2, the effect of impulsivity on meaning in life was also significant ( b = -1.403, p < .001). In step 3, after including the mediator variable meaning in life as a predictor in the regression model, the effect of both meaning in life and impulsivity on internet addiction was highly significant. Meaning in life was thus a significant part mediator ( △R 2 = .606, p < .001)of the association between impulsivity and the outcome variables. This significant mediation effect is depicted in Fig 2 .   10.1371/journal.pone.0131597.t002  Table 2  Summary of hierarchical regression analysis for meaning in life in mediating the relationship between impulsivity and internet addiction.

Moderation of self-esteem and meaning in life on internet addiction  Table 3 shows self-esteem as a moderator of the path from meaning in life to internet addiction, which was tested by the regression analyses just discussed. We controlled for age and gender here, and paths are labeled with coefficients from the regression equations used to estimate the predictor variables. First, internet addiction was predicted by the moderated variable and independent variable (β = -.55, p < .001). Subsequently, meaning in life was predicted by impulsivity and self-esteem (β = -.56, p < .001). Then, internet addiction was predicted by impulsivity, self-esteem and meaning in life (β = -.46, p < .001). Last, internet addiction was predicted by the moderated variable, meaning in life, self-esteem and meaning in life*self-esteem (β = -.25, p < .001). The R-square value changed due to the introduction of the interaction term in the analysis ( △R 2 ≤ .05). The significant interaction effect supported our hypothesis of moderated mediation.   10.1371/journal.pone.0131597.t003  Table 3  The buffering effect of self-esteem on the relationship between meaning in life and internet addiction.

Meaning in life and self-esteem as synergistic factors  Given that there was an interaction between meaning in life and self-esteem on one’s likelihood of internet addiction, post-hoc analyses were conducted and plotted [ 68 , 71 ]. Fig 3 shows the results of these analyses. As meaning in life increased, internet addiction decreased. It is clear from the beta values for the prime condition that meaning in life positively predicted internet addiction scores for participants in both the low self-esteem and high self-esteem conditions. However, the relationship between meaning in life and internet addiction was stronger for those with low self-esteem than for those with high self-esteem. When meaning in life is low, low self-esteem has a substantial effect on internet addiction. Results from the post-hoc probing indicate that the slopes for high and low values of the moderator were significantly different from zero, further supporting moderation.   10.1371/journal.pone.0131597.g003  Fig 3   Regression lines for relations between meaning in life and Internet addict as moderated by self-esteem.

Discussion  The results of the present study reveal the relationship between several variables. One such relationship is the significant direct effect of impulsivity on internet addiction. Our finding is in line with numerous studies that demonstrate that individuals with higher trait impulsivity are more likely to engage in impulsive internet use [ 15 , 72 ].  The present research also supported that the effect of impulsivity on internet addiction is partially mediated by meaning in life. Partial mediation such as that found here is common and accepted in the behavioral sciences, as complete mediation is quite rare in this domain. There is theoretical support for depression, anxiety, lower for self-directedness and cooperativeness variables pathways to impulsive addictive behaviors. The nature of the relationship between impulsivity, meaning in life, and internet addiction is complicated. Meaning is recognized as a central human motivation [ 73 ], and living a meaningful life is associated with positive functioning [ 74 ]. For instance, purpose in life predicts better emotional recovery from negative stimuli [ 75 ]. However, meaning in life may be more distal as a protective factor.  College students are in a key life stage centered around the search for meaning and establishing self-identity [ 76 ]. Finding meaning in life is a critical dilemma for these students undergoing great mental and behavioral development. Students who were retaking the college entrance examination experienced a positive life change and found greater meaning in university life [ 77 ]. However, those with less impulse control and meaning in life may be more susceptible to problematic behavior.  Among the vast array of psychological variables, we chose self-esteem and meaning in life as our focus for important reasons. First, meaning in life is an attitude pertaining much to the external environment, while self-esteem is an internally-oriented evaluation of oneself. Self-esteem is a critical component of any self-improvement or rehabilitation program. Furthermore, high self-esteem individuals have an internal characteristic that to an extent, helps them resist addictive behaviors. An individual with both of these complementary strengths may be the most safeguarded from internet addiction. Second, self-esteem not only affects our values, but our feelings and actions in a variety of circumstances [ 78 ]. While meaning must be based on one’s daily experiences, we infer that high self-esteem can moderate a sense of purpose and meaning in life.  However, it is also necessary to understand other factors from which improper behaviors arise during this dynamic period of development. The self-esteem pathway has received much more attention and consistent empirical support. Prior work suggests that low self-esteem individuals are more likely to be identified as internet addicts [ 79 ]. Individuals at greatest risk for internet addiction possess a combination of boredom with leisure activities and other psychological traits such as self-exclusion, and identity problems. Self-esteem fits in well to the cumulative continuity principle of personality development because the consistency of self-esteem increases with age [ 37 ].  With the growth of positive psychology, the variables of meaning in life and self-esteem have received great attention [ 51 , 80 ]. They may confer synergistic benefits in combating internet addiction. Studying co-occurring protective factors offer a broader understanding of how one factor changes the effect of another on a given behavior. Risk and protective factors are related, but are not interchangeable [ 81 ]. We suggest that people can circumvent internet addiction with resiliency factors. Since meaning in life and self-esteem could both be enhanced in positive psychotherapy [ 82 , 83 ], we present this study as a model to describe possible moderators and mediators that may work in combination to restrain overindulgence in the internet. Our findings also suggest that individuals with high baseline levels of both strengths showed significantly decreased internet addiction relative to their counterparts without these strengths combined.  Taken together, the results reported here imply that meaning in life and self-esteem offer substantial protection against internet addiction. Our findings extend previous research by exploring additional psychological buffers against internet addiction, such as perceived social competence [ 84 ]. To our knowledge, this study is the first to examine meaning in life as it applies to internet addiction. Despite evidence for an inverse association between self-esteem and internet addiction, meaning in life predicted internet addiction only in combination with high levels of self-esteem. As described in detail previously [ 81 ], these findings highlight the importance of attending to psychological strengths in combination, instead of relying on a single predictor.  Our study has several strengths. The findings reported here provide evidence for increased meaning in life as a protective factor in internet addiction. Our findings also provide initial support for two specific psychological strengths working in tandem. The four research variables have been linked to many of the other personality constructs in the extant literature. As impulsivity might not largely decreased by psychological treatment, meaning and life, and self-esteem of psychological variables may instead be more effective in reducing addictive behaviors. This study contributes to diverse literatures, expanding the study of cognition, personality, clinical psychology, and psychiatry.  This study also has limitations. Due to the fact that the design is cross-sectional and correlational, it is limited in its usefulness in determining causality. In addition, our self-reported data may not be reliable, as it is subject to response bias. Because our examination did not control for relevant background predictors, we cannot be certain how well our results generalize to other groups. Future research investigating the same questions using an experimental design and truly random samples would address the limitations just discussed. Last, our results pertain only to meaning in life and self-esteem as protective factors against a general construction of internet addiction. Future research exploring additional personality traits as protective factors would yield more comprehensive insights into countering any specific dependent variables of behavior or substance addictions.    Conclusions  In conclusion, the results of this study support a moderated mediation model of how the discussed constructs influence internet addiction. Empirical examination revealed a stronger indirect influence of impulsivity on internet addiction. Meaning in life and self-esteem can be a useful buffer against internet addiction for at-risk individuals who are highly impulsive. This research supports the utility of inspecting the individual difference mechanisms that might drive the relationship between impulsivity and internet addiction.

The lexical approach is a method in differential psychology that uses people's estimations of verbal descriptors of human behavior in order to derive the structure of human individuality. The validity of the assumptions of this method about the objectivity of people's estimations is rarely questioned. Meanwhile the social nature of language and the presence of emotionality biases in cognition are well-recognized in psychology. A question remains, however, as to whether such an emotionality-capacities bias is strong enough to affect semantic perception of verbal material. For the lexical approach to be valid as a method of scientific investigations, such biases should not exist in semantic perception of the verbal material that is used by this approach. This article reports on two studies investigating differences between groups contrasted by 12 temperament traits (i.e. by energetic and other capacities, as well as emotionality) in the semantic perception of very general verbal material. Both studies contrasted the groups by a variety of capacities: endurance, lability and emotionality separately in physical, social-verbal and mental aspects of activities. Hypotheses of “background emotionality” and a “projection through capacities” were supported. Non-evaluative criteria for categorization (related to complexity, organization, stability and probability of occurrence of objects) followed the polarity of evaluative criteria, and did not show independence from this polarity. Participants with stronger physical or social endurance gave significantly more positive ratings to a variety of concepts, and participants with faster physical tempo gave more positive ratings to timing-related concepts. The results suggest that people's estimations of lexical material related to human behavior have emotionality, language- and dynamical capacities-related biases and therefore are unreliable. This questions the validity of the lexical approach as a method for the objective study of stable individual differences.   This author has no support or funding to report. info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0085677.g002  Introduction   Language, emotionality and energetic capacities likely impose biases in perception of lexical material   Social bias of language  Language is an invention of group dynamics, which functions to facilitate socialization, an exchange of information and to synchronize group activity. The social function of language therefore serves the needs of the society more than the needs of an individual. This explains why there are several language-related biases in our lexicon. For example:   there are more behavioral descriptors of people in active states than in relaxed states;   there are more words related to social than physical aspects of behavior;   there are more words in our language describing negative emotions than positive emotions [1] , and negative descriptors receive more attention [2] – [4]   there are more words describing energetic aspects of behavior than plasticity or tempo of actions.   Contrary to the bias of lexical descriptors in human language, healthy people are in a positive or balanced emotional state no less often than in a negative one, even when there are fewer words related to the positive states; people spend on average a minimum of half a day on either sleeping, napping, sitting while eating, driving, waiting, watching, or not engaging in intense activities. Unless we are talking about teenagers, people are involved in communication no more than in physical or intellectual activities. Furthermore, every action has a certain plasticity of construction and a tempo, i.e. not just the energetic, but also the lability aspects of actions are also present in every performance. These differences between the ratios in language descriptors and the ratios of actual occurrences of certain behaviors, demonstrate a language bias, compromising the validity of the public's evaluations which use lexical descriptors.  In addition to the social bias of language, people tend to conflate properties and traits that are similar in appearance, and this makes their opinions unscientific and unreliable [2] , [4] – [8] . People's perception of “psychological types”, for example, are used by the lexical approach to derive a model of personality dimensions. In using this example, the conflation of the properties of an object of analysis (structure of human individuality) emerges when characteristics tend to either enhance or diminish each other's visibility when they play as an ensemble.  For example, high sociability (social endurance) is more noticeable in people with a high tempo of speech, or with high empathy, or with high impulsivity and adventure seeking. That does not mean that people with a low tempo of speech, or well-regulated people, or people avoiding risks cannot have high sociability. At the other extreme, well-regulated, intelligent and secure people, who have a low need for social approval and therefore low socialization, were thrown together by the lexical approach models into one (“introvert”) group with unempathic (psychopathic or autistic) people and/or people with low physical energy. Research into flat affect shows that patients with this symptom may be more affectively responsive than has usually been assumed. According to patients' reports as well as electrodermal measures of arousal, flat-affect patients actually have the same or even a higher affective response that do normal individuals [9] – [10] . It has been suggested that the discrepancy between the experience and expression of emotion (“affective incongruence”) may result from neuromuscular abnormalities that prevent normal (or even abnormally intense) emotions from being expressed in normal ways [11] .  Anxious people were inferred to have a strong inhibitory system, and impulsive people were inferred to have a strong activation system. In clinical practice, however, anxious patients, especially children, show higher impulsivity and inability to focus than non anxious people. Another confusion is the attribution of impulsivity to highly active people with approach and sensation seeking tendencies, and of low-risk and low impulsivity to highly intellectual people. In reality, intellectual people are endowed with all kinds of “temperament packages”, including high or low sociability, with or without autistic tendencies, as well as with or without impulsivity, sensation seeking or high verbal-social tempo. Indeed in self-confident and/or energetic people, impulsivity is more visible when present, but depressed people, especially people with comorbid depression and anxiety, who report fatigue and slow-down also have impulsivity symptoms [12] . Such attribution errors are common, because a group of traits with similar behavioral appearances is more noticeable and can be attributed to one factor more readily than in cases where the same traits have “conflicting” directions.   Emotionality bias of cognition  Another factor that compromises the objectivity of people's evaluations: an impact of emotionality on cognition. Findings in neuropsychology showed that emotional evaluation always comes prior to the detailed cognitive assessment of the events, due to the lead of subcortical brain structures in information processing. Both subcortical and cortical structures are involved in emotional processing via multiple routes [13] – [16] . Vuilleumier and colleagues in their fMRI studies of the amygdala and related brain structures found a key role of these structures not only in emotional processing, but also in attention and perception [17] – [18] . Their results showed that emotional processes can modify perception – an effect that they called “emotional attention” [19] . Similar interlocking between emotionality and cognition was described be Pessoa [20] – [21] . Adolphs, Tranel and Buchanan [22] reported that enhanced memory for the visual details of a negative item within the affective-attentional network does not lead to the successful encoding of all deta ils of an item's presentation. Activity in these affective processing regions showed no correspondence (in the case of the amygdala) or a negative relation (in the case of the orbito-frontal cortex, striatum, and anterior cingulate gyrus) to the successful encoding of the task performed with an item. This means that even though emotional processing dominates the first stages of evaluation and creates emotionality bias, it misses important details of the perceived objects.  These neuropsychological findings, which showed how unconscious emotional processing can affect human cognition, were reflected in theories of emotionality, offering the concepts of “primary appraisals” [23] , “basic emotions” [24] – [25] , “core affects” [26] , “somatic markers” [27] as pre-cognitive emotional dispositions [28] – [29] . This was in line with common observations from clinical psychology and psychiatry on biased perceptions of patients with mood disorders, based on the same neurochemical factors as temperament. The presence of a background emotionality seems to be a built-in primary biological component of semantic processing (facilitating approach-withdrawal behavioral reaction) not only in humans, but also in other animals, including the most primitive ones [30] . More recently direct studies of the impact of emotionality on the semantic perception of amodal lexical material reported a negative bias in the semantic perception of socially anxious and neurotic people [31] – [33] .  With such a strong and direct impact on cognition, emotionality can collapse the structure of perceived phenomena into just two dimensions related to emotional valence. There are indeed two valence-based biases noted in neurophysiological studies of emotionality.  First, emotional arousal has a well-documented negativity bias [1] – [4]  [34] – [36] . There are more cognitively distinct negative emotions than positive ones [37] – [38] , and people appeared more likely to feel multiple positive emotions at one time than multiple negative ones [39] . A negative default reaction has been observed in human affective judgments [40] – [41] , judgements of objects, events, or choices [42] – [43] , and event-related brain potentials to affective stimuli [44] . Meta-analysis of autonomic activity in response to all negative emotions combined compared with all positive emotions combined also showed a negativity bias. The components of autonomic response (diastolic blood pressure, blood volume, cardiac output, left ventricular ejection time, pre-ejection period, pulse transit time, heart rate) had significantly greater activation during negative than positive emotions, and no autonomic responses showed the opposite pattern [44] .  Second, socialization and perceived social support was found to have a positive emotionality bias. Mu-opioid receptors (MOP) inducing positive emotionality were found to be important players in the perception of social support [45] and in motivation by possible engagements in activities [46] . The impact of MOP and oxytocin on perceived social support and affiliative behavior was found to include dopamine (DA) release: both MOP and oxytocin induce this release during pro-social behavior. DA release in projections between NA, VTA and medial PFC also plays an important role in affiliative behaviour [24] , [47] , and an activation of the 5-HT2A receptor in hypothalamus reportedly increases hormonal levels of oxytocin, prolactin, ACTH, corticosterone, and rennin [48] . There are numerous reports on the role of oxytocin in perceived social support [47] , [49] – [50] , in affiliative behavior, and the formation of social memories [47] . Moreover, gonadal steroids, and vasopressin were found to have modulating effects on sensory, perceptual, and attentional processing of affiliative stimuli [49] . There are obvious evolutionary benefits for the development of a positive reinforcement system for socialization in humans, which we do not discuss here.  The bottom line is that these two regulatory systems – a system of emotional arousal and a system of affiliative behavior – are just two among many systems regulating human behavior. They, however, differ from other systems by having the power to induce a negative or positive emotional bias onto cognitive evaluations, due to the above noted interlocking between emotionality and cognition. As a result their biases will more likely appear in human estimations and even in the lexicon. The unconscious contribution of emotionality to cognitive processes raises concerns about the scientific validity of models that are based on people's evaluations, and not on experimental or clinical work.   Capacities-related bias in estimations of lexical material  Physical and social capacities were found to be interlocked with the way how people evaluate stimuli. For example, physical exercises were found to shift perception to more positive evaluations and even to endorphin-based improvement of depressive symptoms [51] – [54] . People with higher endurance in communication were reported to perceive neutral abstract concepts significantly more positively [31] and performed better on recall or categorization of emotionally positive words [32] – [33] , than other temperament groups in these studies. A series of theories of embodiment, which echoed James-Lange theories emerged in cognitive psychology during the past 20 years [55] – [63] .  Trofimova [31] , in her study of the impact of sex and temperament on the perception of common words, described the phenomenon of « projection through capacities ». Such a phenomenon emerges when a person's evaluations depend on their capacity to handle the events, and such evaluations therefore have bipolar outcomes (“can handle” or “cannot”) with corresponding positive or negative emotional dispositions towards the subject of evaluation. In projection through capacities, individual information processing therefore has a capacity-related bias, as the individual registers mostly those aspects of objects or of a situation that they can properly react to and deal with according to their inherent capacities (including a capacity to avoid harm). The interlocking of energetic capacities with emotional valence is in line with the idea of embodiment in cognition (supporting James-Lange theory) and the findings that the same neurochemical agents (neuropeptides and monoamine neurotransmitters) are involved in both energetic and emotional regulation of behavior. Such interlocking between energetic status and emotionality suggested that the largest dimensions in lexical approach models, i.e. Extraversion and Neuroticism, are not independent and essentially represent one dimension, and that executive and evaluative systems regulating human behavior might have a much closer interaction than was previously thought. This questions the benefits of a dimensionality-oriented approach in differential psychology, including the use of factor analysis, which relies on the independence of dimensions.   Lexical approach models might not be applicable to investigations in biology of individuality, due to language, capacities and emotionality biases  The lexical approach in differential psychology involves people estimating very long lists of words for describing human traits and characteristics. A factor analysis is then applied in order to classify the traits into factors presented as dimensions of personality. The lexical approach was used by Cattell to derive his 16-factor model [64] and by a number of researchers proposing 5-factor models [64] – [71] . The modern 5-factor model was named the “Big Five” by Goldberg, and was intensively promoted around the world by McCrae and Costa [71] .  Since phenomenon of personality is to a large extent a product of individual's socialization it would be natural to investigate how linguistic processes reflect the human perception of individual differences. This is a subject of investigation of cognitive psychology and, to a degree, personality psychology. The problem with the lexical approach arises when researchers manipulating the lists of verbal descriptors of personality present their models not as an interesting artifact of human verbal cognition or socialization processes, but as revealing a real core of biologically based individual differences in humans.  For example, researchers of the Big Five model claimed that it is capable of reflecting the structure of the biological systems of individuality (called either “first order” or “second order personality traits” within the lexical approach, and which are called “temperament”here), just by application of factor analysis to the lists of personality descriptors. (Note that temperament was a topic of research for over 100 last years, especially in European tradition in the work of Kant, Pavlov, Heymans, Wundt, Stern, Lasursky, Jung, Adler, Kretschmer, Spranger, Teplov, Nebylizyn, Eysenck, Thayer, Gray, Tellegen, Rusalov, Netter, Watson and Tellegen, Strelau, etc. Historically the North-American tradition of temperament research was scattered within three different disciplines: developmental psychology, psychiatry and personality theory looking for biologically based traits using a lexical approach. This might explain frequent misconception on North American psychology that “temperament is the same as personality”). In other words, the conclusions on the structure of biologically based traits were made using cognitive psychology methods.  The main assumption of the lexical approach is that correlations between common verbal descriptors of personality correspond to correlations between biologically based systems of human individuality. Only if this is true then the models of lexical approach can claim that they found a structure of the biologically based systems of individuality, and not just the nature of verbal descriptors themselves. To sort out whether or not the relationships between verbal descriptors can be considered as a representation of relationships within real biological systems of individuality we should look at: 1) nature of the descriptors (their source, scientific validation, possible biases), and 2) completeness of the list and any asymmetries in distribution of these descriptors that might lead to biases in resulting factors (keep in mind that the size of factors and the pattern of loadings are the direct reflection of such relationships).  1) In terms of the nature of lexical descriptors or their perception, the arguments above showed that they have at least three well-recognized types of biases: the socialization-bias of descriptors themselves, capacities-related (embodiment) bias and an emotionality bias in cognition. There are too many words related to socialization, in comparison to other words (socialization-language bias); there is a negativity bias in words related to emotionality; and there are more words related to energetic rather plasticity aspects of activities (capacities bias). Due to social and emotionality biases in our lexicon, if we collect all words related to individual differences and apply either factor analysis or just common perception in order to group these descriptors into conflating characteristics, the largest factors (groups) will be a) the words separated by the criteria of pro-social and socially-pragmatic values (Extraversion, or Activity are the candidate names) and b) the words contrasted by emotional valence, with a prevalence of negative emotionality, due to the prevalence of such words in human lexicon.  That is what happened to early temperament models and to the personality model of the lexical approach (often generalized as a general model of human individuality). Practically all early temperament models (starting from Kant's presentation of Hippocrates's four temperaments along the dimensions of Activity and Emotionality), which were based on people's observations (Kant, Wundt, Heymans, Adler, Kretschmer [72] – [75] ), came up with two dimensions – those describing emotionality and energetic aspects of behavior. As language- and emotionality-biases are real and very strong, it is not a surprise that two factors of the Big Five model (Extraversion and Neuroticism) consistently appeared in the personality research performed in various cultures, and three other factors (Openness to Experience, Conscientiousness and Agreeableness) failed to show the same consistency across cultures or even within the same culture for different age groups [76] – [77] . The outcomes of the lexical approach in its contribution to differential psychology were, therefore, rather modest. Testing thousands just to confirm the relative independence of the two major dimensions of temperament would seem a rather expensive enterprise, especially since these two dimensions were already described in differential psychology for at least a century.  The emotionality bias in cognition implies that higher emotional people might have a greater bias and less ability to distinguish between non-evaluative criteria of assessment than lower emotional people. If so, there is a possibility that, if we rely on the estimations of verbal material by lower emotional people, it will diminish the emotionality bias (even though the language bias will remain). On the other hand, the estimations of lower emotional people might bring more contextual diversity, which would produce so much variance that it would result in too large a portion of variance unexplained by the resulting factors. The first possibility would improve the validity of the lexical approach, and the second possibility would not. The lexical approach does not differentiate between high-emotional and low-emotional people, but it is not clear if using it with low-emotional people would make any difference. Based on the reported emotionality bias in cognition, there are high chances that this bias affects the results of factor analysis, gluing criteria of estimations of highly emotional people in evaluative manner.  The existence of language- and emotionality biases in verbal descriptors of human behavior has serious implications for the use of the lexical approach in differential psychology. If these biases indeed exist then the models of lexical approach reflect only relationships between the lexical descriptors of human individuality, and not biologically based systems of this individuality. For this reason science usually does not rely on inexpert evaluations of words describing natural phenomena, but experiments and natural observations of these phenomena are used instead, especially when it comes to claims in regards to biology and physiology.  This paper investigates if and how these biases show up in different temperament groups, but before we focus on the details of the study, let us briefly comment here on the second key flaw in the clam of the lexical approach related to a discovery of biological systems of individuality.  2) As noted, in order for lexical approach models to reflect the nature of phenomena under study (biological systems of individuality) their lists of descriptors should be complete and should arise within the scientific, not the general, community. Eschewing experimental and physiological techniques for investigation of what biological regulatory systems indeed exist, lexical approach researchers also insist that their concept of personality is practically equal to the concept of temperament. In American psychology every time that a study on temperament is performed, it is common for reviewers to demand the inclusion of references to findings from some lexical approach study.  Meanwhile temperament is defined as the most consistent, biologically based dynamical aspects of behavioral regulation, which are relatively independent from educational and socio-cultural impact [78] – [84] . Similarly to other factors which depend on neurochemistry and neurophysiology of the body (such as sex and age), temperament should be treated as comprising the biological systems of human individuality, and not personality. Similarly to the interaction of sex- and age with social factors leading to specific personality peculiarities, temperament also interacts with socialization factors; it is a different, more basic and older concept than personality, and has its own research field. There is more than a century of findings from experimental studies on the structure of temperament, clinical work in differential psychology or studies in neuropsychology by Pavlov, Spranger, Stern, Lasursky, Jung, Teplov, Nebylizyn, Eysenck, Rusalov, Strelau, Cloninger, Robbins and Everitt, Halgren and Marinkovic and many prominent neuropsychologists ( [78] – [93] – see the review of temperament models and references in [28] – [29] , [83] , [94] ).  On this criterion of completeness the lexical approach also shows significant flaws: it completely misses the regulatory characteristics related to lability of behaviour (plasticity-rigidity, tempo of verbal or physical activities). Yet, these characteristics are well-known for being based on biological systems. Pathologically low plasticity (perseverance) has been described in clinical cases of frontal lobe damage for over 70 years. Contrary to unification of endurance and tempo under one dimension of Extraversion in the Big Five model, these characteristics are based on different biological systems: just consider the difference between capacities used by marathoners and sprinters.  More specifically, it was suggested that temperament appeared to regulate three dynamical aspects of activities (energetic, programming-lability and sensitivity-orientational), multiplied by two probabilistic levels of regulation (stereotypical, learned vs. new or complex activities). There also are different traits regulating three distinct functional aspects activities of activities (motor vs. social vs. mental) and there are, of course, at least three types of emotionality traits (neuroticism, confidence and impulsivity), which do not substitute for energetic or plasticity components of behavioral regulation [28] – [29] , [83] , [94] , [95] . These dynamic properties, described by the concept of temperament, traditionally were considered separately from content-related aspects of behaviour, such as values, beliefs, knowledge, motives, preferences, i.e. the key components of personality. After all, content-related aspects were thought to be mainly based on socio-cultural factors, and temperament is based on biological factors. Ever since it was described by the physicians Hippocrates and Galen 2500 year ago, European researchers of temperament linked it to the properties of nervous systems, neurochemistry and endocrinal regulation of the body.  This work showed much higher, nonlinear, dimensionality and complexity in biological regulation of behavior, even though these models also included emotionality and energetic dimensions. After all it is hard to believe that complex human behavior would be regulated just by two biological systems. Robbins and Everitt [92] pointed out in regards to the concept of Extraversion that “ various indices of arousal do not intercorrelate to a high degree, as would be expected of a unitary construct (Eysenck, 1995), and putative manipulations of arousal, whether pharmacological or psychological, do not interact in a manner suggestive of an underlying unidimensional continuum ” (p.703). Instead they described not one, but rather four reticular arousal systems, related to four types of neurotransmitters.  There have been practically no studies (except the cited three [31] – [33] ), which directly investigated all named biases in the semantic perception of verbal material. One of the main reasons for this is the methodological challenges involved in studies perception of the meaning, i.e. semantic perception.   Methodological considerations of studies investigating the semantic perception of lexical material  The main challenge in studying the semantic perception of words is the diversity of meanings and associations that people attribute to the words. Meaning appeared to be individually unique and different not only between people from different cultures, social and family background, but also between all individuals. Many parametric methods appeared to be useless in measuring meaning, as what psychomantics does looks like comparing oranges and apples.  The first success in identifying commonalities in semantic perception came with Kelly's [96] theory of personal constructs. This theory suggested that people assess events and objects using criteria (“constructs”) of a bipolar nature. Subsequently, a branch of cognitive psychology, psychosemantics, was established and flourished after Osgood [97] demonstrated the existence of at least three universal dimensions in semantic perception in people from 24 cultures. Osgood named the three most commonly found factors “Evaluation” (which included, for example, the scales “pleasant-irritating”, “clear-dirty,” “kind-cruel”), “Activity” (“energetic-constrained”, “monotonous-keen”, “fast-slow”) and “Potency” or “Power” (“strong-weak”, “firm-flimsy”, “massive-miniature”). Eventually it was noticed that Osgood's factors present predominantly evaluative (emotional) criteria for the assessment of objects.  The evaluative nature of Osgood's three dimensions of semantic perception was often presented as a criticism of Osgood's findings, but what is important in the context of this paper is that the scales had a tendency to glue together into factors in a rather consistent manner, regardless of the objects of estimation. The fact that the scales' grouping was not related to the specifics of objects, was bad news for the lexical approach. This meant that people, as observers, had some intrinsic structures in their semantic space that could impose consistent biases on their estimations.  At the same time, studies of human and animal cognition showed that our perceptual processing is organized not only around assessing the valence of objects or events, but also around probabilistic features. Subsequent studies in psychosemantics found a few additional universal dimensions: “Typicality”, or “Probability” (“typical-exclusive”, “regular-rare”) [31] , [98] , “Improvement”, or “Organization” (“organized–non-organized”, “regular-spasmodic” “constant-changeable”, “precise-indefinite”), “Reality” (“imaginary-real”, “evident-fantastic”, “abstract-concrete”), “Complexity” (“complex-simple”, “mysterious-usual”, “unlimited-limited”), Stimulation (“interesting-boring”, “trivial-new”) [31] , [99] – [100] , and other small factors. These findings suggested that people might be using non-evaluative criteria (complexity, organization, stability and probability of occurrence) and evaluative, emotion-based (“good-bad”, “exciting-boring”) criteria independently. Such independence of non-evaluative criteria in semantic perception would validate the lexical approach method.  A common way to extract biases in meaning attribution is to apply projective methods, using material of a very general nature, which is open to individual interpretation. Projective Semantics [31] , [101] based on Osgood's [97] Semantic Differential method (SD), asks people to estimate well-known general concepts using common adjectives in the form of bipolar scales. These scales are then grouped into a small number of factors to facilitate the analysis. The difference between the Semantic Differential and the Projective Semantic methods is that the SD studies conducted by Osgood or his followers used various numbers (between 15 and thousands) of diverse adjectives and concepts to be assessed. The Projective Semantic method uses primarily concepts of a very specific nature: these nouns correspond to the 7 groups (factors) of adjective-scales, which were those most consistently found in cross-cultural studies, as described in the previous paragraphs. Seven types of adjective scales and seven types of concepts describing the same aspects of reality as the scales establish the object-scale symmetry (OSS) between scales and objects, which improves the sensitivity of the method to any bias in responses.  For example, if there are no differences between participants in the perception of the common words, then the concepts “Reality”, “Present” are expected to be assessed unequivocally as “very real” on adjectives such as “real-imagined” (i.e. scales of the Reality factor); the concepts “Complexity”, “Chaos” as “very complex” along the scales of the Complexity factor, the concepts “Beauty”, “Freedom” are expected to be on the positive pole on the Evaluation scales, “Time”, “Development” – on the negative pole of the scales of the Stability factor, etc. It is expected that a deformation of this symmetric and very basic matrix would reveal underlying biases of two types: in either using certain scales and/or in the assessment of certain concepts. The concepts are chosen to correspond not only to the groups (factors) of scales, but also to temperament traits, i.e. to the dynamical characteristics of behaviour (Effort, Work, Relaxation – to scales measuring endurance; Speed, Motion – to scales related to Tempo and Plasticity of activity; Prestige, Reputation, Beauty – to Emotionality scales) and to the scales related to different areas of activity, such as physical (Motion, Work, Speed), social (Society, Person, My contemporary) and intellectual (Complexity, Chaos, Time, History).  Before we summarize the hypothesis and methods, the following requirements should be mentioned, which narrowed the focus of our study:   A concern about an impact of culture and education on the semantic perception of lexical material. Since Luria's experiments in the 1930s within low-educated cultures it was shown that culture is an important determinant of which kinds of non-evaluative criteria people use for classification and evaluation (See [102] for review). One component of the educational impact is a previous functional experience related to the objects of assessment. We agree with Cree and McRae's [103] differentiation between amodal semantics, sensory/functional semantics and domain-specific semantics (which classifies objects according to concrete, knowledge-based features). The assumptions of the lexical approach relate to amodal semantic perception as this approach was applied to the concepts of personality and human character, and searched for cross-cultural universality. Our study therefore should, similar to the lexical approach, focus on amodal (and not so much on sensory/functional or feature-specific) semantic perception using the most common lexical material, accessible for all cultures and educational levels.   A concern about a situational embodiment effect. The idea that the somato-visceral feedback from the body affects the emotional perception of an individual was suggested independently by James and Lange at the end of the 19 th century. It was echoed in Bernstein's work on action construction [104] – [105] , who concluded that the initial stage of our attribution of meaning to objects is related to a body-object interaction (p. 126). Several constructivist theories suggested that evaluative and motor systems of behaviour do not function in parallel, but rather work in an ensemble, simultaneously constructing an action every time anew based on the state, need and resources of the body [27] , [31] , [55] , [104] – [108] . The embodiment theories of cognition suggested that neurophysiological systems involved in physical action contribute to the representation and comprehension of language stimuli [56] – [63] , [109] – [113] . Fast implicit motor activation during language processing was found to be an important component of disposition for semantic retrievals [59] – [63] . Moreover, it was shown that the brain appears to process meaning attribution to words in a modality-specific manner when it comes to concrete activities and objects [61] , [109] – [114] . To control these effects, in addition to the application of amodal lexical material, a setting up of physically identical conditions for all subjects would help to minimize a possible situational embodiment-related bias (i.e. bias based on the specifics of body-object interaction in a given moment). The difference between the majority of embodiment studies using tasks of specific modalities and this study is that the experimental groups of the former were contrasted by more diffuse (unrelated to specific actions) dynamical aspects of behavioral regulation: endurance, changeability, directionality of behavior. In contrast to the well-defined anatomy of motor and sensory systems, temperament is based on the neurochemistry of the body (neurotransmitters, neuropeptides, opioid receptors and hormones), and therefore this study presents a different aspect of embodiment research.    Goals, hypothesis and methodological considerations of the present studies  One of the assumptions behind the lexical approach, which this study challenged, is that existing relations between features of human behavior will be adequately reflected in correlations between lexical descriptors of behavior without any language or emotionality bias. Therefore, one of the goals of our study was to investigate whether temperament groups, which are contrasted by the energetic and sensory capacities perceive lexical material differently. More generally, it was investigated if semantic perception of lexical material differed between these contrast groups for verbal non-evaluative criteria of organization, probability, complexity and stability. The first, the projection through capacities hypothesis, was based on embodiment theories and on reports describing the interlocking between capacities and emotionality, and between emotionality and cognition. According to this hypothesis people with higher endurance or tempo in either physical or social aspects of behaviour perceive objects, even amodal verbal material, in more positive terms in comparison to their opposite temperament groups.  It is not at all clear, however, whether people with higher social-verbal endurance and tempo of speech have more adequate semantic perception of lexical material than people with higher intellectual or physical endurance. These people might either have a more detailed perception of social concepts, or, alternatively, the social nature of language might create a positive bias in their perception in favor of socialization-related concepts. Mental (intellectual endurance) is expressed in individual attentive abilities. It is possible that people with higher scores on this trait might have more adequate use of criteria in the assessment of abstract concepts.  Moreover, the logic of embodiment theory suggests that lability traits of temperament (ability to restructure actions and tempo of performance) might have an impact on the perception of time-related lexical constructs. To date there has been practically no research focusing on the semantic perception of time concepts by people with different speeds of performance. The only study with such focus was conducted by Trofimova [31] , which used a small number of scales and concepts. This study reported that participants with higher physical tempo perceived abstract concepts as more fast, more energetic and acute whereas participants with higher verbal tempo perceived the same object as more constant. As an indirect indication of the body's-tempo-related bias in the perception of action verbs, several studies showed a presence of motor activation during the processing of these verbs [112] – [113] , [115] – [116] . Based on these results we hypothesized that people with a stronger dynamical (temperamental) system generating a tempo of performance will project more energetic and speedy properties to abstract concepts than people with slower tempo.  Our second goal of the study was related to the assessment of a possible impact of language (socialization) bias, especially in the perception of lexical material by people with high social-verbal capacities. The second, language bias hypothesis, suggested that people with stronger endurance and tempo in verbal-social activities would differ from people with stronger motor-physical or intellectual endurance in their semantic perception of lexical material. Moreover, as a part of this hypothesis we investigated if temperament traits which are not related to socialization or emotionality (such as plasticity and tempo) will have any interaction with semantic perception of lexical material.  The third goal of this study was to investigate if there is a conflating impact of emotionality bias in the use of non-emotional criteria of estimations. If there is no such emotionality bias, then the non-evaluative (probabilistic or structural) criteria would be used independently from evaluative criteria in semantic processing. If there is such emotionality bias, the polarity of non-evaluative criteria would be conflated with the valence of evaluative criteria. Our emotionality bias hypothesis suggests that emotional dispositions create a universal, object-independent bias in meaning attribution, and that this bias is especially strong in amodal semantic perception (i.e. when no concrete feature-specific objects are given, and a person has to assess abstract lexical material). We hypothesize that this bias might be so strong that it forces non-evaluative criteria to follow the valence of emotional evaluative criteria. In this case the background emotional component of semantic perception would correlate (or “glue”) parameters of assessment into the factors regardless of the objective features of these elements.  At this point we have three hypotheses, which relate to capacities-, language- and emotionality biases in semantic perception. In order to separate these biases in our investigation we had to use experimental groups that were contrasted by various aspects of physical, social and intellectual capacities and emotionality. Temperament traits are hard to monitor in short-term experiments, as they emerge only as consistent behavioral patterns in a variety of situations over long periods of time. Such monitoring is especially challenging if we need to study all traits at once. Neurophysiological methods for separating contrast temperament groups are also not developed yet, as temperament traits are based more on neurochemical processes rather than brain morphology, visible in neuroimagery studies. For these reasons the main instruments to diagnose temperament are validated temperament tests.  The present study used the activity-specific tests of temperament, which make the most detailed differentiation between all main aspects of temperament (i.e. biologically based systems regulating behavior). Both tests were developed within the longest-running (Pavlovian) experimental tradition investigating properties and types of nervous systems. These tests are called “activity-specific” because they differentiate between temperament traits regulating physical, verbal-social and mental aspects of actions [39] , [94] – [95] , [117] – [120] . Both tests consists of 12 temperament traits: 3 traits of Emotionality and 9 executive traits (related to energetic, lability and orientation aspects of actions, each considered in 3 types of activity – physical, social and mental). Such an integrated approach (admittedly complicating the readability of the results) was necessary to analyze for the possibility of interactions between the three described biases in the perception of the participants of the study.  In sum, to test our hypothesis we used 12 independent variables, corresponding to 12 temperament traits. Dependent variables were not single measures, but patterns of relationships between multiple semantic measures (scales). The analysis was focused on both quantitative (statistically significant differences) and qualitative effects (the way that these differences were grouped along the poles and features of the scales). We expected the following:   If the “ projection through capacities ” hypothesis is true, the results would show: a) that people with higher endurance attribute more positive meaning to neutral common words than people with low endurance; b) that people with higher tempo would have universally higher estimations to timing-related concepts (Time, Motion, Development, Speed) than other temperament groups.   If the “language bias” hypothesis is true, a temperament group with higher verbal-social endurance will give more positive estimations of concepts than other temperament groups, due to their better verbal capacities;   If the “ emotionality bias ” hypothesis is true, then a) the differences in estimations on non-evaluative scales (describing probability, complexity and organization aspects of concepts) would follow the same polarity as on evaluative scales (which belong to Evaluation or Stimulation factors); b) emotional reactivity, as an expectation of a failure, will affect the estimations of people with higher emotionality or neuroticism, emerging as a universal negative evaluative bias in their estimations.    Method, Study 1   Sample  846 undergraduate psychology students of McMaster University and Brock University (Southern Ontario) (85% of the sample) and volunteers from the same area aged 17–52, M/F  = 331/545 participated in this study in 2000–2003. All participants were fluent in English. After validity procedures were applied the final sample included 312 men, M age ± SD  = 21.9±7.4 and 506 women M age ± SD  = 20.5±5.4.   Procedure  The study received an approval from the McMaster University Ethics Committee for all procedures. All subjects received debriefing and signed an informed consent form and then completed the Extended Structure of Temperament Questionnaire and participated in the experiment. University students received a practicum credit for their participation.  The Extended Structure of Temperament Questionnaire (STQ-150) [83] , [95] , [117] – [118] has 150 statements to be answered with a Likert scale format: “strongly disagree (1),” “disagree (2),” “agree (3),” “strongly agree (4)”. Six items are assigned to the validity scale, and 144 items to 12 temperament scales (12 items each). (A brief summary of the validation history of the Extended and Compact STQ is given in Text S1 ). The scales are as follows (alpha values are given in parenthesis based on the data in this study):  1–3. Scales of Motor, Social and Intellectual Endurance (“Ergonicity”) (ERM, ERS, ERI), assessing the ability of an individual to sustain prolonged physical (alpha = 0.83), social (0.83) or mental (0.73) activity respectively.  4–6. Scales of Motor, Social and Intellectual Tempo (TMM, TMS, TMI) assessing the speed of manipulations with objects (0.72), tempo of verbal activity (such as talking and reading) (0.75) and tempo of performing intellectual tasks (0.70) respectively.  7–9. The scales of Motor, Social and Intellectual Plasticity (PLM, PLS, PLI) assessing the ability to adapt quickly to changes in instructions or circumstances in object-related operations (0.71), communication (0.77) or intellectual activity (0.71) respectively.  10–12. The scales of Motor, Social and Intellectual Emotionality (EMM, EMS, EMI) – assessing sensitivity to failure and to success in physical (0.74), social (0.71) and mental (0.75) activities respectively.  Protocols having scores of 18–24 on the Validity scale were considered invalid as the respondents were likely to demonstrate a positive impression bias in their responses.  The Semantic Task experiment used 60 6-point bipolar scales to estimate the 29 general concepts ( Table 1 ) chosen according to the Projective Semantic method as described above. Each concept was presented by the program “Expan” on a computer monitor at the top of the screen along with each of the bipolar evaluating scales placed horizontally at the middle of the screen (i.e. 1740 screens were presented for the estimation). Both poles of the scales had 3 degrees of freedom (“very much”, “somewhat”, “weakly”). The order of scales and concepts was changed for each protocol to avoid the consecutive use of several scales related to one factor.  10.1371/journal.pone.0085677.t001 Table 1  The list of scales (grouped into 7 factors) and concepts used in the Study 1.

The implication was that participants might over/underestimate the expression of their dynamical traits under the influence of social expectations, but they could be more objective about which temperament characteristic is stronger or weaker in comparison to their other characteristics. For each protocol, the scores on 12 scales were transformed into 12 ranks. The protocols were sorted into three groups with lowest, middle and highest ranks and the contrast (i.e. lowest (1–4) and highest (9–12)) groups were processed further. Table 2 shows the sizes of the contrast groups, and Table 3 shows the statistical details related to temperament scores. The differences in estimations were assessed with the Mann-Whitney U test, separately for men's and women's contrast temperament groups (based on 12 scales of the STQ-150). To control multiple comparisons using the Bonferroni correction the significance of differences was set to p <0.0063.  10.1371/journal.pone.0085677.t002 Table 2  Sizes of the temperament contrast groups.

Factor analysis confirmed the affiliation of the scales to seven factors, as presented in Table 1: Stimulation, Evaluation, Power, Reality-Probability (typicality), Organization, and Stability-limitation. Figure 1 shows the number of statistically significant (at p <0.0063) differences in estimations in the following groups of concepts: “People”(Person, Unknown person, My contemporary, Society), “SocialAt” (social attractors: (Prestige, Reputation, Beauty, Freedom), “Reality” (Reality, Present, Life), “Work” (Work, Task, Activity, Effort), “Time” (Time, Speed, Motion, Development), and “PastFut” (Past, Future). Other concepts did not show noticeable significant differences in contrast temperament groups, except 2 cases: “Power” in the male Social Tempo contrast group, and “Simplicity”, “Order” in the female group contrasted by Motor Tempo (marked as SimpOr in the Figure 1 ).  10.1371/journal.pone.0085677.g001 Figure 1  The number of statistically significant differences in estimations of contrast temperament groups, Study 1.  Axis Y: the total number of significant differences; the sign indicates the pole of the scales chosen by the group with the higher scores on a given temperament trait. The colours represent the spectrum of these differences along seven factors to which the scales are associated. Axis X: groups of concepts (see text for details).   In more detail, Figure 1 assigns a specific color pattern to each of 7 factors (connotative groups), to facilitate the perception of the spectrum of significant differences. The height of the pattern is proportional to the number of scales related to the particular factor that showed significant differences, with greater heights representing more scales (see Table 4 , Table S1 for statistical details). The position of the patterns with respect to the zero line indicates the polarity of estimations preferred by the group with the higher scores on a given trait, i.e. to which side of the scale this group's means were closer. The above 0 position indicates that means were closer to the positive pole of the scale; below 0– to the negative pole, see Table 1 for the assignment of poles. For example, for the concepts of social attractors, Figure 1 , Table 4 (and Table S1 ) shows that in total 10 scales had significant differences in the male group contrasted by Social-verbal Endurance trait. From the height of each pattern one deduces that there were significant differences on the scales of the Stimulation (2 scales), Probability (2 scales), Organization (3 scales), Stability (1 scale) and Complexity (1 scale) factors. This stacked column shows that the estimations of socially energetic men are significantly closer to the positive poles on Stimulation, Probability and Organization descriptors and to the negative pole on Stability and Complexity adjectives than those given by lower energetic men. Similarly, for the same concepts and the same temperament group (high Social Endurance), but in the female sub-sample, there were 9 scales, with the height of the patterns indicating significant differences on 4 Probability scales, 3 Organization scales, and also 1 Stability and 1 Complexity scale, with highly social women preferring the positive poles of the eight scales.  10.1371/journal.pone.0085677.t004 Table 4  Selected list of the significant differences in estimations of contrast temperament groups, Study 1.

Groups of concepts: “People”(Person, Unknown person, My contemporary, Society), “SocialAt” (social attractors: (Prestige, Reputation, Beauty, Freedom), “Reality” (Reality, Present, Life), “Work” (Work, Task, Activity, Effort), “Time” (Time, Speed, Motion, Development), PastFut” (Past, Future). “SimpOr” (Simplicity, Order).  The results show that in terms of capacity-biases effects, a high number of statistically significant differences were found for male groups contrasted by physical (Motor) Endurance. Men with reported stronger physical endurance estimated work- and time-related concepts significantly more positively than men with reported weaker endurance. The same positive bias, but with a smaller number of statistically significant differences, was found in male estimations of people- and reality related concepts and social attractors. Temperament groups contrasted by Social-verbal Endurance (ERS) showed a positive bias in estimations of socially energetic participants, which was consistent across two sex groups and all groups of concepts.  In terms of lability-related temperamental traits, males with higher scores on the scale of Motor Tempo had significantly more positive estimations of timing-related concepts than the opposite temperament group, but this was not the case for female groups. At the same time males with a faster Tempo of Social-verbal activities had significantly more negative estimations of Power and Timing-related concepts than males with a slower Social Tempo. Men with higher Social Plasticity gave significantly more negative estimations to social attractors and work-related concepts than men with lower Social Plasticity scores.  The differences between social, physical and intellectual endurance were that 1) higher social-verbal endurance was associated with a more general positive bias in estimations, and that 2) intellectual endurance (ERI), i.e. the ability to stay focused on a mental task, was associated in females with a bias that was opposite to social and physical types of endurance. Women with a higher ERI estimated social attractors, work-related and timing-related concepts with more negative bias than women with the lower ERI scores. Men with higher ERI scores however gave more positive estimations of reality-related concepts than males with lower ERI.  In terms of emotionality effects, non-evaluative scales followed the polarity of evaluative scales in a very consistent manner ( Fig. 1 , Table 4 ). For example, whenever a temperament group assessed the concepts as more “good” and “interesting” (i.e. with more positive estimations on the scales of Evaluation and Stimulation factors than the contrast group), it would also assess these concepts as more “organized”, “probable”, “real” and “stable” (i.e. also with positive estimations on the scales of Organization, Probability-Reality and Stability factor.  The impact of Emotionality traits was not universal across objects (concepts). It was specific to possible areas of failures and was gender-specific. The most dramatic number of significant differences was observed in temperament groups contrasted by Social Emotionality and Social Endurance. Socially emotional men saw people-related, reality (life)-related concepts and social attractors as more draining, uninteresting, irritating, severe, dark, dirty, cold, false, unknown, improbable, irregular, irrational, senseless, and unstable than socially low-emotional men. Female groups contrasted by Social Emotionality differed in their estimations of timing-related (Time, Speed, Motion, Development), and work-related concepts (Work, Effort, Task, Activity). Socially emotional females saw these concepts more negatively than low-emotional females. Not shown in the Figures or Tables: females with higher Social Emotionality estimated people-related concepts as less interesting ( p  = 0.0017), and life/reality-related concepts as more negative along fours scales of the Evaluation and Stimulation factor) than low-emotional females ( p  = 0.0000–0.0048).  A differential impact of Emotionality related to physical-Motor activities (EMM) in male contrast temperament groups was observed for people-related concepts: men with higher scores in this type of emotionality estimated the concepts Person, Unknown person, Society and My contemporary as more simple and overall more positive than low-emotional men. There were sex differences in contrast EMM groups also in estimations of social attractors and reality-related concepts: while female contrast groups did not show many differences (one in each group of concepts). Men with higher EMM scores estimated social attractors as significantly more imaginary, impossible and unusual, and reality-related concepts as chaotic, irregular, rare, imagined and unstable than low-emotional men.  Overall, male groups had a much higher number of statistically significant differences between contrast temperament groups than females. Males also had more diverse scores on temperament scales than women (their standard deviation was higher than female SD s on 9 out of 12 scales (exceptions were Social Plasticity, Motor and Intellectual Emotionality scales) ( Tables 2 and 3 ). An ANOVA comparison of the means revealed male superiority in six temperament scales: Motor-physical Endurance (ERM) (at p <0.0000), Motor Plasticity (PLM), Motor Tempo (TMM) (at p <0.0025-0.0029), Intellectual Endurance (ERI) (at p <0.0042), Intellectual Plasticity (PLI) and Intellectual Tempo (TMI) (at p <0.0000). Females had superiority in Social Endurance (ERS) (at p <0.003), Social-verbal Tempo (TMS) (at p <0.0000), and higher Emotionality in Intellectual (EMI) and Social (EMS) aspects of activities (at p <0.0000). The scales of Social Plasticity (PLS) and Emotionality in motor-physical (EMM) activities did not show significant sex differences ( Table 3 ).

Method, Study 2  This study was investigating the same hypothesis as the Study 1 using a partially different version of the temperament measure.   Sample  378 undergraduate psychology students of McMaster University (Southern Ontario) (81% of the sample) and volunteers from the same area aged 17–53, M/F  = 140/238 participated in this study in 2006–2008. All participants were fluent in English. After validity procedures were applied the final sample included 131 men, M age ± SD  = 21.2±6.97 and 219 women M age ± SD  = 20.0±5.23.   Procedure  All subjects received debriefing, signed an informed consent form, then completed the Compact Structure of Temperament Questionnaire (STQ-77) and participated in the Semantic Task experiment.  The Compact Structure of Temperament Questionnaire (STQ-77) [83] , [94] , [119] – [120] has 77 statements, assigned to 12 temperamental scales (6 items each) and the validity scale (5 items) listed below. Subjects respond according to a Likert scale format: “strongly disagree (1),” “disagree (2),” “agree (3),” “strongly agree (4)”. The scales are:  1–3: Endurance group, scales of Motor, Social and Intellectual Endurance: the ability of an individual to sustain prolonged physical (ERM, apha  =  0.85), social (ERS, 0.80) or mental (ERI, 0.71) activity.  4–5: Lability group, scales of Motor and Social Tempo: preferred speed of physical activity (TMM, 0.70), speed of speech and reading and of other verbal activities (TMS, 0.75) and Plasticity scale, assessing the ability to adapt quickly to changes in situations, to change the program of action, and to shift between different tasks (PL, 0.71).  6–9: Sensitivity group: Sensitivity to Sensations scale (SS, 0.73), assessing the sensitivity of an individual to basic physical sensations and pleasures, a tendency for sensation-seeking and risk-taking behaviour; Empathy scale (EMP, 0.70) assessing sensitivity of an individual to another person's emotional state, and Sensitivity to Probabilities (PRO, 0.72) scale assessing ability of an individual for adequate understanding and expectations of probable events, the efficient extraction and processing of new knowledge.  10–12: Emotionality group: Self-confidence scale (SLF, 0.70): the tendency to be optimistic and confident (sometimes overly optimistic) in own performance, to ignore other people's warnings and criticism; Impulsivity scale (IMP, 0.74): the lability of emotional reaction, a poor ability to control immediate impulses for actions; Neuroticism scale (NEU, 0.71): low tolerance of uncertainty with expectations of a negative outcome.  13. Validity scale - social desirability tendency in answers. Results within the range of 15–20 on the validity scale should be considered invalid as the respondents are likely to demonstrate positive impression bias in their responses.  The Semantic Task experiment and statistical procedures were similar to Study 1. The only difference was that participants assessed 24, and not 29 concepts, with the concepts Task, Effort, Unknown person, My contemporary and Reputation excluded.   Results, Study 2  Figure 2 , Tables 2 , 5 , 6 and S2 summarize the results in the same fashion as was done in Study 1. The concepts were organized into the following groups: “People” (Person, Society), “SocialAt” (social attractors: (Prestige, Beauty, Freedom), “WorkRe” (Work, Activity, Reality, Present, Life), “Time” (Time, Speed, Motion, Development), SimpOr (Simplicity, Order, Faith, Relaxation) and “PastFut” (Past, Future).  10.1371/journal.pone.0085677.g002 Figure 2  The number of statistically significant differences in estimations of contrast temperament groups, Study 2.

In regards to the “projection through capacities hypothesis”, males with stronger Motor Endurance (ERM) estimated people-, work/reality- and time-related concepts in more positive terms than males with a weaker endurance. Females with stronger ERM estimated social attractors in more positive terms than females with weaker ERM. Both male and female temperament groups with stronger Social-verbal Endurance showed a universal positive bias in their estimations, especially for social and work/reality-related concepts, in comparison to participants with lower sociability. A trait of self-confidence created a positive evaluative bias only in estimations of social attractors, and only in men.  In terms of tempo-related scales, the most significant positive bias in estimations of men with higher Motor Tempo was found in their evaluation of time-related concepts.  Similar to the findings of Study 1, social, physical and intellectual endurance were associated with different biases in estimations. When significant differences were found between the temperament groups contrasted by physical and social endurance, the people with stronger endurance had a more positive evaluative bias than people with weaker endurance. Intellectual endurance, however, was associated with a negative evaluative bias. Women with higher Intellectual Endurance estimated social attractors as more unstable, disorganized, negative and non-stimulating compared to women with the lower ERI. No differences were found in the male groups.  In terms of emotionality, the differences on non-evaluative scales (i.e. included in factors of Probability-Reality, Complexity, Stability and Organization) followed the polarity of differences on evaluative scales (included in factors Evaluation, Stimulation, Power). Men with higher Neuroticism scores on the STQ-77 estimated people-related concepts in more negative terms than low-neurotic men, but almost no differences were found for social attractors in both male and female groups contrasted by neuroticism. Both men and women with high Neuroticism and high Empathy estimated work- and reality-related concepts with negative bias in comparison to low-neurotic and low-empathic groups. Highly neurotic women also gave more negative evaluations to timing-related concepts and to the Past and Future than their contrast temperament group.  Temperament traits related to different types of sensitivity – sensitivity to sensations, sensitivity to probabilities, empathy and neuroticism – all had a polarity of bias, which was opposite to those of physical and social endurance traits (in the cases when significant differences were found). Both men and women with higher Sensitivity to Sensation (SS) scale of the STQ-77 gave more negative estimations of work/reality-related concepts than participants with lower sensation seeking. The Sensitivity to Probabilities scale, which measures a person's ability to learn and to derive causal relationships, showed effects in the male contrast group: men with high scores on this scale estimated social attractors and time-related concepts as significantly more bad, cold, insignificant, imaginary, unusual, blurred, irregular, unreliable and slow than men with lower scores.  Men with higher ranks on Sensation Seeking scale estimated the concepts Simplicity, Order, Relaxation and Faith as significantly less stable, organized (!), and real than low sensation-seekers. At the same time participants with high Social Endurance (sociability) in both sex groups gave more positive evaluations than their contrast group.  Overall male contrast temperament groups had a higher number of statistically significant differences between them than did the female groups ( Table 6 , Figure 2 , Table S2 ). An ANOVA comparison of the means revealed male superiority in seven temperament scales: Motor-physical Endurance, Motor Tempo, Sensitivity to Probabilities (at p <0.0000), Plasticity, Self-Confidence (at p <0.0003), (EMP) (at p <0.009) and Intellectual Endurance (at p <0.01). Females had superiority in Social-verbal Tempo (at p <0.0001).   Discussion  In theory, and from the lexical approach perspective, there should not be any temperament-related differences in the assessment of amodal common concepts using very common adjectives, especially in people with at least high school education in a developed Western country. The experimental material in our studies had a very general and non-biased nature. Yet, a complex pattern of significant temperament-related differences was found in semantic perception even for words with a very high level of generality. The results were more profound for the STQ-150, in comparison to the STQ-77, but this might be due to the size of the samples.  Our projection through capacities hypothesis was supported in comparisons of estimations of temperament groups contrasted by two (physical and social-verbal) types of endurance and tempo. When significant differences were found, participants with stronger physical or social endurance in both studies gave more positive ratings to concepts than participants with weaker endurance of these types ( Figures 1 – 2 ). Men with weaker motor endurance but with faster social-verbal tempo had even more negative estimations of work- and reality-related concepts than women with the same traits ( Figure S1 , Table S3 ). This was consistent with the positive evaluation bias observed in extraverts in other studies [31] – [33] . Significantly fewer differences were found between the temperament groups contrasted by intellectual endurance, and when such differences were found they had a pattern opposite to the groups contrasted by the other two types of endurance (physical and social). In line with our hypothesis, men with higher Motor Tempo and Endurance gave more positive ratings to timing-related concepts than did their opposite groups. It was interesting that in both studies significant differences were found for the concepts Order and Simplicity (i.e. the concepts requiring an opposite to lability) between female temperament groups contrasted by lability traits (Motor Tempo in Study 1 and Impulsivity in Study 2). Faster and more impulsive females saw these objects in more negative terms.  In regards to our “ language-bias ” hypothesis, we found a strong pro-social bias in estimations of general concepts. The scales of Social-verbal Endurance, and Social emotionality/Neuroticism were associated with much more significant differences in estimations, in comparison to all other temperament scales, and this was observed in both studies. Social endurance had the most number of significant differences, and people with high social endurance had a tendency for more cheerful estimations, even when it came to non-social concepts (such as Work-Reality, Simplicity-Order or Timing groups). Social emotionality, i.e. sensitivity to failures in social activities, produces a much stronger negative affective bias in meaning attribution than sensitivity to failures in physical activities.  Moreover, the concepts related to social attractors and “people” had the highest number of significant differences between temperament groups. If the strongest effects, i.e. the largest variance in data are produced by the difference between estimations of social vs. non-social people, and to a lesser degree – by any other temperament types, then the factors resulting from public assessments of individuality would reflect mostly socialization aspects. The pro-social bias of language skews the frequency of common lexical descriptors related to socialization vs. other aspects of behavior and therefore makes these descriptors an unreliable source of information, especially in regards to psychological phenomena, which has a strong social component. Such a pro-social bias of lexical material in semantic processing supports our arguments about flaws (namely observer's bias) in the lexical approach as a method of investigation of the structure of some objects. If the strongest effects in lexical approach studies are induced by the estimations of either socially emotional or socially active people, this makes modeling within the lexical approach “ a science of extraverts ”, with limited benefits for general differential psychology.  Our third hypothesis was also supported, and this finding was in line with the neuropsychological reports of the interlocking of emotional processing with attention and perception [20] – [22] . Overall the pattern of our results showed the existence of an initial evaluative stage in human semantic perception, which uses two emotional poles even in estimations of abstract neutral concepts. A strong effect of emotionality bias was found in a universal tendency across objects for non-evaluative scales to follow the same polarity as the scales for the Evaluation and Stimulation factors (for example, whenever a contrast temperament group assessed a concept as more “good” and “interesting”, it would also assess this word as more “organized”, “probable”, and “real”). Such grouping (“gluing”) of non-evaluative scales with evaluative criteria was described in Kelly's theory and was likely the reason for Osgood's factors to have a strong evaluative content. It is likely that in the perception of the words related to more concrete objects, this primary stage of meaning attribution is followed by other stages of detailed, knowledge-, education-, experience- and intelligence-driven meaning attribution.  More importantly, the inherent bipolarity and evaluative nature of amodal semantic perception means that this bipolarity can be projected onto the properties of objects of estimation. It is likely that when the lexical approach asks people to estimate individual characteristics of other people using just verbal descriptors, bipolar evaluative bias will dominate over other criteria of assessment. This emotionality bias, combined with the social nature of language, would divide all non-evaluative features of an object into groups of features related to the interests of the society. In the example of the models of individuality offered by the lexical approach, these categories would relate to social approach and withdrawal behavior. Such a division would present the perspective of a socialized and emotional observer, judging the object's (i.e. personality's) features primarily from the point of view of socialization, but omitting other important (non-evaluative) features of the object. As a result, when the lexical approach or parental verbal observations are used to derive a model of personality or temperament “in the way how people see it”, it is natural to expect that the biggest dimensions of the model would be Extraversion and Neuroticism, or Approach and Withdrawal, or Positive/Negative emotional dispositions.  Even more problematic are the claims of the lexical approach that this method found the structure of all biologicall y based individual differences. In spite of the intensive promotion of the Big Five model, it does not correspond to the findings in experimental (i.e. more objective) and neurophysiological studies in differential psychophysiology. These findings indicated that there are important biologically based characteristics, that are unrelated to socialization or emotional evaluation, and therefore were unnoticed by a human observer of personality or temperament structure. For example, the lability of behavior (mobility-rigidity of generation of an action, impulsivity, preferred tempo of performance) and traits related to the types of preferred reinforcers (sensations seeking, empathy, causal thinking) were differentiated from endurance traits in experiments on the properties of nervous systems and in several temperament models [78] – [91] , [94] – [95] , [117] – [118] , but were missed in lexical approach models of individuality. Moreover, extraversion, described as a dimension related to the energetic aspects of activity, missed a differentiation between several types of endurance: social-verbal (ability to sustain prolonged conversations), mental (ability to stay focused on mental tasks) and physical. Yet, the differentiation between these three types of endurance is in line with the functional specialization of temporal, frontal and sensory-motor cortex [83] . (Note that recently, to accommodate these findings Big Five researchers had to use additional techniques in factor analysis, presenting sociability, impulsivity, positive affect, empathy, self-confidence and (in some models) sensation seeking as “second order” traits, i.e. components of extraversion. This did not help to overcome a bipolar emotional division of traits: positive affect was identified as a part of Extraversion, and negative affect – as a part of Neuroticism, even though affective systems are based on different neurophysiological systems than other components of these traits).  There was an aspect of emotionality bias, which we did not expect in our hypothesis, but which suggests an interaction between emotionality and capacities-related biases. This aspect relates to a specificity of emotional sensitivity to lexical material, even when the most amodal and abstract material is used. In line with observations in clinical psychology, our results showed that people with higher sensitivity to failure and neuroticism had more negative estimations of neutral abstract concepts, i.e. emotional negativity bias. Such effects were, however, far from being universal across both gender groups and the objects of estimation. Negative affect had a tendency to color the perception of emotional people in relation to specific possible areas of their failures, and not blindly to all objects. For example, socially emotional and neurotic men in both studies perceived people-related and reality-related concepts more negatively than their contrast groups, but men who were sensitive just to their failures in physical activities saw people-related concepts significantly more positively than low-emotional men. Interestingly, when temperament was not considered, males estimated social attractors (Beauty, Prestige, Reputation, Power) more positively than women while few sex differences in estimations were found for the concepts describing “people” [101] .  Further evidence of the impact of emotionality in an object-specific manner was that socially emotional and neurotic women perceived time-related concepts in more negative terms than other concepts. This is consistent with the more negative estimations of women on timing concepts when temperament differences were not taken into account [76] , [121] and significantly lower scores on the temperament scales of Motor Tempo in women, in comparison to men in both studies ( Tables 3 – 4 ). To integrate the results from Trofimova previous [101] and the present studies it can be proposed that, judging by lower emotionality scores on temperament scales in men, it almost looks like men usually care less about their social failures than do women, but those who do care (i.e. men with Social Emotionality) have really big issues, namely, with people, and much less so with social values. Women's emotionality, however, simply affects their meaning attribution when it relates to the perception of concepts of speed and timing, in which they feel inferior.  Similarly to the results of the studies of sex differences in the semantic perception of lexical material [101] , [121] , men had more negative evaluations for work- and reality-related concepts than women ( Figure S1 and Table S3 ). This coincides with the findings of Study 2 that both men and women with high sensation seeking evaluated these concepts more negatively than participants with lower sensation seeking, and that men with higher sensation seeking estimated the concepts Simplicity, Order, Relaxation and Faith as significantly less stable, organized, and real than low sensation-seekers. Men are reported to have higher risk- and sensation-seeking behavior, especially in youth [91] , and it is natural to see that concepts related to routines are perceived more negatively by men than by women [101] , [121] . This study did not find significant differences between men and women on sensation seeking per se, but it is possible that it is extreme temperament traits that induce the biases in semantic perception. For example, men with both lower and higher social endurance gave significantly lower evaluations for work- and reality-related concepts than women with such traits ( Figure S1 ).  Different types of sensitivity (sensitivity to probabilities, to other people's state (empathy), to physical sensations (sensation seeking), neuroticism) were associated in Study 2 with either no differences or negative estimation biases by people with high scores on such sensitivities. Here we see how easy it is for humans to be confused about the structure of individual differences when different traits “look the same” on a bipolar dimension related to emotional or social behavior. People with high sensitivity of very different types (sensation seeking, empathy, probabilistic thinking), people with high attentive abilities and people with lower physical and social endurance are likely all to have negative evaluative biases and could be classified as one group (previously known as “introverts”). People with high endurance and tempo, but of different kinds, as well as people with poor attention (intellectual endurance) are likely to exhibit positive evaluative biases, and from the emotionality and socialization point of view they would all be in a group of “extraverts”. Such emotional biases in semantic perception, endorsing socialization-based categories over other structural analysis was likely the reason why early differential psychologists came up with two-dimensional models based on either two poles of emotionality or dimensions of Energy-Strength-Activity-Arousal-Extraversion and Emotionality-Neuroticism.  These findings and arguments question the validity of the lexical approach in differential psychology, which derives the structure of human individuality based upon people's estimations of verbal material (see Discussion of the Controversial Issues for further discussion on related controversial issues). The coupling of several types of biases in the semantic perception of lexical material likely affects the way that scales group into factors in the factor-analytic models of the lexical approach, and masks important objective features of the assessed objects. Repeating the application of this approach in dozens of languages brings consistent results because it doesn't change the social-evaluative nature of lexical material and doesn't improve the flaws of this approach. Besides, the use of linear factor analysis, which looks for independent dimensions, is hardly appropriate in psychological investigations due to nonlinearity, feedback and contingent relationships (i.e. interdependence) between psychological characteristics. Similar to deriving a structure of an object by measuring its shadows on the walls, deriving the structure of biologically based individual differences from people's lexical appraisals of observable behavior is likely not a very informative scientific method.  In summary, our studies showed that capacities-related, language-related and emotionality biases in semantic perception make people very unreliable observers, especially when lexical material is used and when it comes to assessment of social or people-related concepts.  The limitation of the study was related to the use of self-evaluation tests to assess the temperament traits. Considering that 12 temperament traits had to be measured in the same sample, only one method could be realistically implemented: the use of self-report test with the calculation of the rank of capacity to which an individual feels a given trait was developed. The use of a rank-based instead of a value-based system for classification of subjects into the contrast temperament groups (as described in Method section) hopefully addressed this limitation.   Conclusions  Our studies investigated an impact of biases related to biologically-based capacities, language and emotionality on the semantic perception of lexical material. All three types of biases were found, even though the lexical material was of the most neutral, abstract and amodal nature.  In line with the “projection through capacities” hypothesis and previous findings, we found that people with higher physical and social endurance gave more positive evaluations to neutral concepts than people who felt that their endurance was rather weak. Moreover, participants with faster physical tempo gave more positive estimations to time-related concepts than participants with slower tempo. These findings reflect on another aspect of embodiment in cognition: such embodiment emerges not only as an impact of the situational physical state of a body, but also as a contribution from the consistent dynamical (potential rather than situational) capacities of the body in the semantic perception of lexical material.  A language bias in lexical material was identified when experimental groups contrasted by social emotionality, social endurance and social tempo showed the highest number of effects than the groups contrasted by other abilities. The concepts related to social objects had more significant differences between these contrast temperament groups than the non-social concepts.  A strong impact of emotionality appeared in findings that non-evaluative criteria for categorization (related to complexity, organization, stability and probability of occurrence of objects) followed the polarity of evaluative criteria, and did not show even a weak independence from this polarity. Moreover, neurotic people did not have a universal negative bias in their perception, and negativity bias was rather specific to words describing potential areas of failure in various contrast groups. This was an indication that emotionality bias overpowers semantic perception and collapses differentiation of all other possible descriptors to bipolar emotional criteria.  Overall these findings suggest that people's estimations of lexical material related to human behavior are 1) capacities-biased; 2) unreliable, judging by the opposite patterns in estimation of different temperament groups; 3) influenced by the social nature of language, designed to improve processes of socialization and social interaction, and 4) driven by emotionality, which shrinks the dimensionality of possible criteria into bipolar evaluative constructs. The described biases in estimations of lexical material lead to a collapse the complexity of perceived objects into two or even one dimension based on emotional valence. The study shows that such a collapse happens even for the most neutral and abstract lexical constructs.  This questions the validity of the lexical approach as a method for the objective study of psychological phenomena (including the example of biologically-based individual differences, which was discussed in this article).   Discussion of the Controversial Issues  This paper suggests that the lexical approach is not an appropriate tool for the investigation of biologically-based traits (called in differential psychology “temperament”). The lexical approach might still be a valid tool for the investigation of social-verbal phenomena, including the influence of lexical processing on the perception of personality differences. The limitations of the lexical approach discussed here relate to its weakness in representation of biologically-based systems of individuality and not to the way in which socialization shapes our perception of personality types. These comments will likely meet objections from personality psychologists using the Big Five model. During the process of review and revision of this article several issues were discussed that are relevant in addressing such objections. The author is grateful to the reviewers and to the editor for suggestions for clarifying the author's position on the following issues.   1  Lexical approach is an analysis of relationships between lexical descriptors of behavior, and not actual behaviour . For those who defend lexical approach models it is useful to keep in mind the nature of the material that these models are based on. The dates of publication are given here to underline the time line of this research. This approach started when Allport (1937) suggested that since most relevant personality characteristics are encoded in natural language we can derive all aspects of individuality just using language descriptors. It was assumed that even biologically based characteristics will be fairly reflected in language. Now we know that this is not true, and that language is by nature a social invention, designed to reflect primarily socialization aspects of human life, and not biological factors of individuality. Moreover, there is a strong positive emotionality bias associated with socialization processes and a negative emotionality bias in people with high emotional arousal. A more detailed review of lexical approach research can be found in John and Srivastava (2001), but in brief the Allport-Odbert collection consisted of about 18000 personality descriptors, which several American psychologists tried to sort out, including Cattell (1945). Cattell selected a subset of 4,500 descriptors, converged it to 35 variables and 16 factors, and developed his famous 16-PF personality test. By the way, similarly to the modern Big Five authors, Cattell also claimed that his 16 factors showed excellent correspondence across methods, such as self-reports, ratings by others, and objective tests; Similarly to the Big Five, Cattell's 16-PF test was translated into many languages and widely distributed in the psychological market. The main criticism of the test was related to its poor psychometric properties, but this is likely due to flaws in the research methodology, and not the psychometric product reflecting the dimensions obtained at the 1st stage.   Several other American researchers used factor analysis of other lists of descriptors: Fiske (1949) used 22 descriptors from Cattell's list and received 5 factors; Norman (1967) compiled a new list of personality descriptors and sorted them into 75 variables, which Goldberg (1990) used as scales in his FA. Goldberg had a series of studies using 1710, 475 or 435 trait adjectives with various groupings into clusters and factors. In several studies he used self and peer ratings using the selected adjectives, and then conducted FA on his data. He consistently received a 5-factor solution, similar to the 5-factor solution received by Tupes and Christal (1961), Norman (1963), Borgatta (1964), Digman and Takemoto-Chock (1981) and then promoted by McCrae and Costa (1992). Moreover, in cross-cultural studies the same approach was used: it started from the collecting of lexical descriptors in other languages, with application of FA to group these descriptors. After difficulties replicating the same 5-factor structure in several languages, cross-cultural studies shifted to simple adaptation of the NEO-FF to other languages and verification of the psychometric properties of new versions of the test.  In other words, the Big Five was developed based on research that used subjective selection of lexical descriptors, and self- and peer assessment of correspondence between (only these) descriptors and observable behavior. And that is what the Big Five represents: a consistent model of how humans reflect individuality using language, no more. There were no considerations of findings in neuroanatomy, neurochemistry, experimental psychology, observations of behavior of people or animals in real situations – none of this was used at the research stage leading to the development of the Big Five. In this sense we can say that the Big Five does not represent the structure of temperament or the structure of biologically based traits, even though lexical perception reflects some elements of it.   2  Why the results of this study do not confirm the validity of Big Five model of personality but rather show its deficits . This article suggests that models of lexical approach reflect only relationships between the lexical personality descriptors that affected by three types of biases, and do not present biologically based systems of human individuality. We noted that there are at least three biases that are present in human lexicon and that can compromise the results of factor analysis in lexical approach: too many words related to socialization, in comparison to other words (socialization-language bias); negativity bias in words related to emotionality; and more words related to energetic rather plasticity aspects of activities (capacities bias). Plus the descriptors of individual behaviour that the lexical approach is using are borrowed from common language and not from scientific language (experimental studies, clinical observations, modeling, theoretical research). As the result, what the lexical approach found is not the structure of biologically-based regulatory systems (temperament), but the socialization and emotionality biases in perception of lexical personality descriptors. Our study investigated whether temperament traits describing socialization and emotionality will show any interaction, or show different interactions with the perception of verbal material than traits that do not relate to socialization and emotionality. After all, as was described in the article, the impact of emotionality on cognition was shown to be strong and not under the control of the individual. The study showed is that in spite of multiple components within temperament structure, temperament traits influence semantic cognition in concert with the described biases, at least with the negativity bias of emotionality and positivity bias of socialization. The way that they interact (more emotional people indeed have more negative estimations and more social or energetic people have indeed more positive estimations) confirms the interlocking between emotionality, capacities and sociability, on the one hand and cognition, on the other hand. Suggestions of emotionality- and sociability-related biases in the assessment of lexical material are bad news for the lexical approach, and having confirmation of such biases using contrast temperament groups is even worse news.   These biases overshadow temperament traits (neurophysiological systems of regulation) which are not related to socialization or emotionality: plasticity, tempo, impulsivity, differentiation between regulatory systems of mental, socio-verbal and physical aspects of behavior. This means that estimations of lexical material collapse the complexity of perceived objects into two or even one dimension based on emotional valence. The study shows that such a collapse happens even for the most neutral and abstract lexical constructs.  For example, if the descriptors referred to elementary particles and only reflected positive-negative charge-related observations (but not spin, mass, strangeness etc.) we would not be able to differentiate between the particles comprising matter and fields (fermions vs. bosons), or stable and unstable particles. Moreover, neutral particles would not be described at all. Similarly, emotionality bias divides perceived properties into positive and negative valence grouping very different traits into the one category and missing emotionally neutral properties out of its analysis. The lexical approach completely misses the regulatory characteristics related to lability of behaviour (plasticity-rigidity, tempo of verbal or physical activities). Yet, these characteristics are well-known for being based on biological systems. Pathologically low plasticity (perseverance) has been described in clinical cases of frontal lobe damage for over 70 years. Contrary to unification of endurance and tempo under one dimension of Extraversion in the Big Five model, these characteristics are based on different biological systems: just consider the difference between capacities used by marathoners and sprinters.  In summary, the study showed how the emotional cognition of lexical material collapses the dimensionality of perceived phenomenon, and this is not necessarily good news for the Big Five theory. Findings within the lexical approach are useful for investigations of verbal processes within cognitive psychology, but we should not mix common human beliefs with scientific findings in neurophysiology and differential psychology.   3  What the lexical approach missed . As noted above, the three biases in the perception of lexical material collapse the complexity of regulatory systems into two dimensions based on emotional valence. Let us briefly list the aspects of biological systems of regulation of human behavior that are being hidden during such a collapse. It is almost impossible to summarize all important findings in temperament research, neuroanatomy and neurochemistry which relate to these aspects, but here are just several examples:    The findings in neurochemistry indicate that our behaviour is regulated by systems related to the functional aspects of construction of an action: orientation, programming and energetic maintenance (endurance) of an action [92] – [93] , [106] , [122] – [129] . These functional aspects have leading neurotransmitters regulating them (in concert with other neurotransmitters): NE-based orientation system, DA-based programming and integration system and 5-HT maintenance/performance system [28] – [29] , [92] , [130] .   These three aspects are regulated differently during routines, habit/skills formation and habit use – such a habit management system is based on GABA/Glutamate exchange with the three other neurotransmitter systems. Moreover, there are several additional levels (hypothalamic hormones, neuropeptides including opioid receptors) regulating the same functional aspects of behaviour, especially in the deterministic aspects of behaviour [24] , [28] – [29] . Neuroanatomically cortical vs. striatum integration of an action relates to the differences between regulation of novel/complex vs. routine aspects of the action (since [104] – [105] literature is extensive). In this sense a separation between temperament traits related to probabilistic vs. deterministic aspects of behaviour was useful in temperament research.   There are multiple reports indicating that nonlinearity, contingency and feedback processes are essential properties of literally every single neurochemical system of behavioral regulation: serotonin [130] – [131] , monoamines [92] , [132] – [135] , prolactin [136] , hypocretins [137] – [140] , and HPA hormones [141] . What nonlinearity and feedback properties mean is that a linear increase of one parameter (call it a factor if you wish) does not give a proportional response in behaviour (increase or decrease on some observable trait), but instead can have several, often opposite responses in observations. What contingency means is the presence of “if this… then..” in 2-, 3- and multi-way relationships between chemical agents regulating our behaviour. Examine any decent handbook of Neurochemistry (for example, [135] ) to appreciate the complexity of our regulatory system. There is no way that common adjectives related to human behaviour would carefully reflect this complexity if common people, and even a majority of psychologists do not know how their behaviour is regulated (neurochemically) inside their own body.   In spite of the contributions of oxytocin and dopamine systems to th regulation of behaviour they are only a small part of the neurochemistry of behavioural regulation. Moreover, numerous neuropeptides and hormones likely contribute more to biological systems of behavioral regulation (i.e. temperament) than monoamine neurotransmitters.   In clinical psychology and psychiatry there were several observations as well as analyses of the effect of neurotransmitters that resulted in multiple models of temperament (or character) [81] – [82] , [85] .   Developmental psychologists were using parent observations of their children in the study of temperament for more than half of the last century. Even though parents are not the most reliable raters, the fact that these studies used standardized observations of behavioral elements of real individuals (and not verbal descriptors of such elements) makes these studies more valuable contributors to differential psychology than the lexical approach [78] – [80] , [90] .    4  “ A cat knows whose meat she ate .” Temperament research has continued already for more than a century, considering that experiments on properties and types of nervous systems started in Europe in 1906, and a set of temperament models were developed within European psychiatry and American developmental psychology since then. It is a rather parochial position of personality theorists to avoid citation of the findings of these traditions, especially considering that the first models including Emotionality and Activity/Energy dimensions of individuality were developed long before the appearance of the lexical approach (look at the dates: Kant, 1798; Heymanns, 1910–1923). It worth noting that those first models describing these two dimensions targeted an explanation of the nature of Hippocrates' four temperaments. Pavlov's research on temperament, and clinical models of several European psychiatrists were also an attempt to explain the four ancient temperament types. In this sense it would be at least fair to acknowledge that the two main dimensions in the Big Five model (and the only two that showed more or less stability across cultures) were previously described in temperament research. This acknowledgment would of course devalue the novelty of the Big Five model and would suggest that it is in fact temperament and not personality structure that this model describes.   To avoid such devaluation, Big Five papers a) never mention the early two-dimensional models describing four temperament types; b) Eysenk and Gray models are named as models of personality, and the word “temperament” in personality papers seems to be prohibited; c) there are no citations of temperament research in personality journals, whether past or present; d) the word “temperament” is never used for their factors describing biologically based traits; e) whenever an article on temperament comes to a journal of personality it is rejected without review, especially if it does not cite studies using Big Five. You can contact the author for examples.  Personality researchers working within the Big Five seem to have difficulties admitting that they started digging in somebody else's garden and abandoned their own: their subject is the socialization and acculturation processes shaping human individuality, and not biologically based systems of behavioral regulation (temperament). Temperament, similar to sex and age, has nothing to do with socialization, even though, like any other psychological property, temperament interacts with social factors. Also similar to sex and age, temperament relates to neurochemical systems, and social-cultural factors have a rather minimal influence on it. It is wrong therefore to believe that “temperament is almost the same as personality”, or that “temperament is under the umbrella of personality”. We don't put concepts of sex and age under the umbrella of personality, even though studies show personality changes with age, and differences in extraversion between men and women. If we don't mix sex and age with personality, we should not do it with temperament. The differences between personality and temperament lie in the differences between biological factors of individuality and products of socialization. Besides, it we want to pick an umbrella, it is temperament that is the more strong and consistent factor determining the behaviour of an individual, with personality-related socialization developing on the basis of temperament during the life time (i.e. it is personality that should be under the umbrella of temperament). The expression about the “umbrella”, however, is scientifically contra-productive. It mixes two different concepts in one pile, and leads to more confusion. It would be more productive if personality theorists would stop downplaying the concept of temperament and the findings within temperament research and not project their lexical models to biological systems of behavioral regulation.   5  We usually do not substitute the theoretical physics with the maintenance reports of technicians serving the equipment . For the same reason we should not judge the validity of a model of individual differences based on the reports of psychometric properties of self-report tests. After all, biological sciences have more weight in determining what biologically-based traits of individuality exist than psychometric measures of self-reports in regards to these traits. If we want to measure biologically-based systems that make people consistently different, a traditional scientific approach consists of two stages The first stage is to identify the biological systems of individuality, i.e. to partition all the behavioral variance into dimensions that later should determine the scales of our “individuality” test. That is what differential psychology and differential neurophysiology do. At this stage of research it would be natural to derive our partitions based on: a) neuroanatomic studies; b) studies of neurochemical systems regulating human behaviour; c) studies of similar biologically-based traits in other mammals, and d) studies of consistent differences between young children (after all, if we study biologically based characteristics of individuality we need to be sure that they are not a product of social expectations and cultural training).   Only when we have an idea of what can be found in biology that makes people different, can we switch to the second, psychometric, stage in the development of our Individuality test. Luckily the findings in research of types and properties of nervous systems, neurochemistry, neuroanatomy and psychiatry have a lot to offer. The psychometric stage has very little to do with biological investigations and should not substitute for the first stage. Psychometrics is a small area of applied psychology, developing techniques for monitoring the quality of psychological tests. The psychometrist's job is to verify that the items in our test reflect whatever researchers have identified as an important regulatory system; that all items along one scale measure the same trait (without asking the same question all the time); that scales are relatively independent and do not influence each other. For whatever properties we identify at the Research stage we can ask test developers to design a device measuring these properties. If we didn't order the test developers to have items reflecting some important property identified at the Research stage – a scale measuring this property would not appear by itself, and existing items belonging to other scales would reflect the void. If we did put too many items related to the same property – we will receive the strongest and most consistent factor, but it might have nothing to do with how important this property is in real biological systems of individuality. In this sense, if the Research stage is not done properly, the resulting test will measure our object only partially and likely from the wrong angle. For this reason the devices used in medicine are based on principles discovered in biology, clinical and chemical studies of actual life systems, and not on the technical notes of the staff tuning these devices.  In summary, the Research stage results in the description of an object to be measured and the nature of this object, which is relevant to obtain for our goals. The Psychometric stage works on the development and perfection of a measurement device to measure only those aspects of our object that the Research stage pointed to. Yet, I often hear often arguments in favour of lexical approach models of biologically based traits based on psychometric studies, including CFA and EFA of their tests. It is the same difference as the difference between theoretical/experimental physics and engineering. Engineers are the wrong people to ask about what the Universe is made from. Similarly, psychometrists are the wrong people to ask about what fundamental, biologically-based regulatory systems humans have: they can not answer questions on the nature of the object that we measure. They can only answer questions about the measurement device.   6  There is a fundamental conflict of interest between psychometrics and differential psychology: dimensionality vs. functionality . This conflict of interest emerges when conclusions are drawn as to the structure of individuality. Psychometrics seeks out independence of a test's dimensions (scales) and (in the best case scenario) correspondence of test items to some actual elements of behaviour. Psychometrics does not concern itself with the nature of these behavioral elements, only about the correspondence between what is observed and the reading on the measuring device. That's where psychometrics and all techniques based on factor analysis (FA) really lose out: they are incapable of dealing with feedback, and nonlinear and contingent relationships between systems. Yet all life systems (including human individuality) are based on such relationships between their components. These relationships mean interdependency between dimensions, and feedback, nonlinear and contingent mechanisms are described in numerous reports within neuroanatomy and neurochemistry. For this reason functionality (the functional role of regulatory systems) rather than dimensionality should provide the main criteria for describing the structure of natural systems.   If we apply a method designed to search for independent dimensions to systems that have strong interdependency – by definition we will have the wrong picture, even though we are guaranteed, like in gypsy fortune telling, to have some sort of picture. For this reason factor analysis is never considered to be applicable in neurochemical or neuroanatomic models and research. Even outside of psychometrics and te lexical approach, FA is almost useless in the derivation of the taxonomy of objects whose elements have contingent and feedback relationships. By my estimation, I have conducted about 2000 FA protocols just over the past 10 years, within my research on the dimensionality of semantic spaces. Thus I am not as scared of criticising FA as other psychologists might be and to say that it is a very weak investigative tool for research on the structural relationships within natural systems. FA is very dependent on what items you put into its centrifuge, and the more degrees of freedom (diversity, variability) our research object has, the weaker are the resulting factors.  This is the position of a differential psychologist. For psychometrists, however, it is very important that the scales are independent and do not overlap. The quality of the test is measured by the independence of the scales. This is problematic as NONE of the traits or properties ever measured by any psychological test are completely independent from any other psychological property. For this reason there is no such a thing as a perfect test, and psychometrists (i.e. people developing tests) try very hard to brush out this interdependence by creating substructures, smaller facets, hierarchy of factors, etc. It is a hard work, but this does not help to change the fact that FA is completely incapable of reflecting feedback and contingent relationships within the systems under study.

Personality features are associated with individual differences in daily emotional life, such as negative and positive affectivity, affect variability and affect reactivity. The existing literature is somewhat mixed and inconclusive about the nature of these associations. The aim of this study was to shed light on what personality features represent in daily life by investigating the effect of the Five Factor traits on different daily emotional processes using an ecologically valid method. The Experience Sampling Method was used to collect repeated reports of daily affect and experiences from 104 healthy university students during one week of their normal lives. Personality traits of the Five Factor model were assessed using NEO Five Factor Inventory. Hierarchical linear modeling was used to analyze the effect of the personality traits on daily emotional processes. Neuroticism predicted higher negative and lower positive affect, higher affect variability, more negative subjective evaluations of daily incidents, and higher reactivity to stressors. Conscientiousness, by contrast, predicted lower average level, variability, and reactivity of negative affect. Agreeableness was associated with higher positive and lower negative affect, lower variability of sadness, and more positive subjective evaluations of daily incidents. Extraversion predicted higher positive affect and more positive subjective evaluations of daily activities. Openness had no effect on average level of affect, but predicted higher reactivity to daily stressors. The results show that the personality features independently predict different aspects of daily emotional processes. Neuroticism was associated with all of the processes. Identifying these processes can help us to better understand individual differences in daily emotional life.   This research was supported by Academy of Finland (grant number 250935).

Neuroticism has been linked to a wide range of psychopathology [2] , [4] . The association of extraversion is notably weaker and more equivocal [2] , [3] , [5] . In a recent meta-analysis, conscientiousness was strongly and negatively linked to psychopathology [2] . There are several alternative explanations for how personality is linked to psychopathology. Features of personality can predispose an individual to illness [6] and may be influenced by current [6] or previous psychopathology [7] , [8] .  Abundant evidence exists for two latent dimensions, internalizing and externalizing, underlying the structure and comorbidity of common mental disorders [9] – [11] . A recent study including epidemiological surveys from 14 countries found that the associations between a temporally primary mental disorder and another subsequent disorder were significantly stronger within than between internalizing and externalizing domains, and provided support for the existence of mediating latent internalizing and externalizing variables [11] . Neuroticism has been linked especially to internalizing, i.e. depressive and anxiety disorders, and their comorbidity in several studies [3] , [7] , [10] , [12] – [14] , and neuroticism shares genetic risk factors with internalizing disorders [5] , [8] , [12] , [15] . Neuroticism has therefore been suggested to be one of the factors mediating risk for a spectrum of internalizing disorders [10] , [16] .  It has recently been argued that neuroticism is a non-specific and overly general trait [1] , [4] . To better understand what neuroticism actually represents, Ormel et al. [17] have suggested “deconstructing” neuroticism by investigating its association with average level of affect separately from its association with reactivity of affect. Alterations in emotional life, especially experiencing strong and persistent negative affect, are closely related to internalizing disorders. Personality features are known to be associated in many ways with individual differences in emotional life, such as negative affect and affect reactivity. It is possible that this could be one of the factors mediating the link between personality features and psychopathology. For example experiencing higher negative affect and being more reactive to stressors in daily life could indicate vulnerability to internalizing disorders. Understanding what personality features indicate with respect to daily emotional processes could therefore help in future research to elucidate the poorly understood link between personality and mood and anxiety disorders.  Much literature exists on neuroticism’s association with negative affect and extraversion’s association with positive affect [18] – [22] . Negative affectivity is a basic and defining component of neuroticism [23] ; however, in a recent study using multiple assessments per day, neuroticism was associated only with lower daily positive affect, not with higher daily negative affect [24] . Higher positive affect and lower negative affect have been associated with agreeableness [22] , [25] , [26] and conscientiousness [27] , [28] . Moreover, while several studies have found no significant association with openness to experiences and positive and negative affect [22] , [26] , [28] , a recent meta-analysis has linked this trait to higher positive affect [27] .  Higher affect variability has been linked to neuroticism in several [24] , [29] , [30] but not all studies [26] . Agreeableness has been related to lower variability of affect [22] , [26] , whereas results for extraversion are ambiguous, with some studies linking it to lower variability [22] and others reporting no association [26] , [30] .  Personality features may also be associated with stress exposure. Individuals with high neuroticism tend to report more negative events in their daily lives [18] , [31] – [33] . On the other hand, extraversion might protect from stressors and predict more positive daily life events [18] .  A fourth aspect of daily emotional processes is affect reactivity. Neuroticism has been demonstrated to be associated with greater reactivity of negative affect to daily stressors in several studies using once-a-day diary reports [18] , [31] , [32] , [34] , [35] or momentary assessments conducted several times a day [36] . However, some studies, including a recent report applying the Experience Sampling Method [24] , have not shown this association [37] . Extraversion has been observed to indicate higher reactivity to positive mood induction in some studies, but a notable number of contrary results also exist [38] – [40] . Furthermore, extraversion has been associated with increased amygdala responses to happy facial expressions and increased electrophysiological brain responses to positive stimuli, suggesting that extraversion could indicate enhanced sensitivity to reward [41] , [42] . The question whether extraverts are less reactive to negative events has gained far less attention in personality research. A recent study however found increased brain responses in extravert individuals for highly unpleasant stimuli compared to neutral, but similar responses for moderately unpleasant stimuli and neutral ones [41] . Less extravert individuals on the contrary had increased brain responses also for moderately unpleasant stimuli, indicating extraversion to associate with lower sensitivity to negative stimuli, This could contribute to higher well-being of extraverts [21] , [41] . In one study, agreeableness was associated with higher reactivity to interpersonal conflicts only [35] .  As described above, the results from previous studies are somewhat mixed and partly contradictory, leaving still largely open the role played by personality features in daily emotional processes. The goal of this study was to explore the daily emotional processes in more detail and with high ecological validity. The study particularly aimed to dissect the daily emotional processes in four different categories; level of affect, affect variability, daily stressors, and affect reactivity, and to investigate how they are associated with different personality features. To our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate the association of the Five Factor personality features with different daily emotional processes separately in the same study. Previous studies, using multiple assessments per day [22] , [24] , [26] , [28] , [36] or a daily diary method [18] , [31] , [35] , [43] , have instead focused on just one or two personality features or emotional processes.  Our primary hypothesis was that neuroticism would predict higher negative and lower positive affect, higher affect variability, more reported negative daily incidents, and higher reactivity to these incidents. Also, by definition, neuroticism is related to negative affect, being vulnerable, unstable and reactive and having poor coping skills [44] , [45] . Based on consistent existing research, we expected extraversion to be associated with a higher level of positive affect [18] – [21] . Although less consistent, previous research also supported an additional hypothesis that agreeableness and conscientiousness would predict higher positive and lower negative affect [25] – [28] .   Materials and Methods   Subjects  Participants comprised 106 university students aged 19–35 years. The subjects were screened with the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I Disorders [46] to rule out any current psychiatric disorders. One subject was excluded because of a current major depressive episode and one because of an insufficient amount of data (see below), thus resulting in a final sample of 104 subjects (18 males, 86 females). The mean age of subjects was 23 years (range 19–35, SD 3.69). They had been high achievers in comprehensive school (grade point average in the highest decile, 9.1 (SD 0.56) on a 4–10 scale, population average 7.5 (SD 0.94) (population average from personal communication with Dr. Juhani Rautopuro, Finnish National Board of Education)).   Ethics Statement  The study was approved by the local ethics committee (Ethics Committee of Helsinki and Uusimaa Hospital District). Oral consent was obtained after careful oral and written information about the study protocol to the participants by the first author and overseen by the principal investigator. Since this study entailed healthy, adult individuals and the study procedures did not infringe on the integrity of the subjects, did not include any sample taking or administration of any substances but rather was observation of the subjects in their normal daily routines, written consent was not required by the ethics committee.   Study Design  Momentary experiences of the subjects were collected for one week using the Experience Sampling Method (ESM). ESM is a momentary assessment method where subjects’ reports are collected randomly in response to a signal of an electronic device [47] , [48] . ESM has been shown to be a valid and reliable method [47] , [49] . Its advantages include the collection of a large number of reports for each subject, the lack of recall bias since it uses real-time assessments, enabling investigation of variation over time, and better ecological validity since it occurs in a natural environment [48] , [50] . For the first half of the sample (51 subjects), the small portable PsyMate device (PsyMate B.V., Maastricht, Netherlands) was used to collect data. For the second half of the sample (53 subjects), an Android smart phone application (OLO ©), developed in-house for momentary assessment purposes, was used. The application worked analogically with the PsyMate. Both were programmed to beep 10 times per day at semi-random intervals (maximum time between beeps 4 h, minimum 15 min) between 7∶30 AM and 10∶00 PM. The subjects were instructed to use the device for 7+/−1 day. At each beep, the device presented a series of questions in a multiple-choice format about current emotions, activities, social context, and events since the last beep. The questions had to be answered within 15 minutes of the beep to ensure real-time assessment. The subjects answered the questions using the touch screen of the device. They were asked to continue their normal lives without changing their daily routines and to keep the assessment device with them at all times. Consistent with previous ESM studies, to include the participant in the data set we required a response rate of at least one in three beeps since this has been shown to be a valid cut-off for reliability [24] .   Measures   Daily life affect  We assessed momentary affective states using words adapted from Russell’s circumplex model of affect [51] . The words selected formed a circumplex with two dimensions, valence and arousal [52] . Negative affect words were the Finnish translations of sad [surullinen] (neutral arousal), nervous [hermostunut] (high arousal), and tired [väsynyt] (low arousal). Positive affect words were cheerful [iloinen] (neutral arousal), excited [innostunut] (high arousal), and content [tyytyväinen] (low arousal). We used the word active [aktiivinen] to measure a high arousal affective state with neutral valence and tranquil [rauhallinen] to measure a low arousal affective state with neutral valence. The subjects reported their current emotions by answering a question, e.g. “Right now I feel sad”, using a 7-point Likert scale (0 = not at all, 6 = extremely).   Affect variability  In line with previous studies, we used the standard deviation of each affect as a measure of affect variability [24] , [30] .   Context and affect reactivity  The subjects reported their current activities (“What were you doing just before the beep?”), events since the last beep (“What was the most important event since the last beep?”), social context (“Who are you with right now?”), and subjective evaluations of these activities.  The sum of the subjective evaluation items “I enjoy this activity” and “I can do this well” (0 = not at all true, 6 = completely true) formed the “quality of activity” variable.  The question referring to the most important event since the last beep “How pleasant was the event” (0 = very unpleasant, 6 = very pleasant) was used as the “quality of event” variable.  Social context was first evaluated with a question about whether the subject was alone or not. If a subject responded not being alone she was next asked if she would prefer being alone (“I would prefer being alone”, 0 = not at all true, 6 = completely true). This was used to assess the subjective “quality of social interaction” from highly negative (6) to highly positive (0) (i.e. if a subject was in company but preferred being alone at the moment, this was interpreted as low quality of social interaction). If the subject answered that she was alone, the next question was whether being alone was by choice (0 = not at all true, 6 = completely true). This response was used in our analyses to assess “quality of solitude” from highly negative (0) to highly positive (6).  As in previous studies [18] , [24] , [53] , [54] , we assessed affect reactivity by the negative affect response to daily life contexts.   Personality traits  The Five Factor personality traits were measured using a Finnish version of NEO Five Factor Inventory (NEO-FFI) [55] , [56] , which the participants completed before being given the assessment device. The questionnaire is answered with 5-point likert scale (e.g. “I am not a worrier”, “I often feel tense and jittery”, “I work hard to accomplish my goal”, 1 = strongly disagree, 5 = strongly agree).   Statistical Analysis  Hierarchical linear modeling (HLM), more specifically linear growth curve models, was used (e.g. [57] , [58] ). HLM takes into account the hierarchical structure of the data, i.e. dependencies of the data on a within-subject level and on repeated measurements. It also allows an unequal number of repetitions. The data were analyzed with MIXED procedure in the IBM SPSS Statistics software, version 21 (IBM Corporation, Armonk, New York, USA). Time of response was used as a level 1 predictor and personality traits or daily contexts as a level 2 predictor. Both level 1 and 2 predictors were fixed, but the parameters (intercept and slope) of the time variable (level 1 predictor) were allowed to vary randomly between subjects. All variables were standardized to allow comparison of the regression coefficients with each other. The outcome, B, is the standardized regression coefficient of HLM and can be interpreted analogously to standardized coefficients in standard regression analyses. All models were adjusted for gender, age, and assessment device used (PsyMate or OLO).  In Model 1, the effect of personality traits on level of affect was analyzed using each emotion as a dependent variable and traits as predictors. In Model 2, the effect of personality on daily incidents was analyzed using subjective evaluations of events, activities, social interaction, or solitude as dependent variables. In Model 3, affect reactivity was assessed. Sadness was selected as a dependent variable to reflect reactivity of negative affect because in Model 1 the personality traits had the greatest effect on sadness of all emotions (see results). In the reactivity model, both traits and context evaluations were used as predictors, and the statistical interaction of trait and context evaluation was used to assess reactivity.  The effect of personality traits on affect variability was evaluated using bivariate correlation analysis. The standard deviation was first calculated for each subject and each emotion (across all responses of each subject). The correlations of personality traits with standard deviations were then calculated.   Results  The participants responded to 54 beeps on average (SD 9.87, range 28–94). The total number of beeps responded to across all subjects included in the final data was 5599. The descriptive statistics of the ESM measurements and the personality features measured by the Five Factor Model are shown in Tables 1 and 2 .  10.1371/journal.pone.0110907.t001 Table 1  Descriptive statistics for ESM measurements and Five Factor personality features.

Agreeableness was significantly associated with higher cheerfulness, contentment, and calmness and lower negative affect. Conscientiousness predicted lower sadness and nervousness as well as higher activeness. Extraversion predicted higher cheerfulness and excitement, but showed no significant associations with negative affect. Openness did not have any significant associations with momentary affect.  10.1371/journal.pone.0110907.t003 Table 3  Standardized regression coefficients from Model 1.

Effect of Personality on Daily Life Contexts  The results of Model 2 are presented in Table 5 . More positively evaluated daily events and activities were negatively associated with neuroticism and positively with agreeableness. Agreeableness was also associated with more positively evaluated social situations. Moreover, extraversion and conscientiousness were associated with more positively evaluated activities, and openness with more positively evaluated solitude.  10.1371/journal.pone.0110907.t005 Table 5  Standardized regression coefficients from Model 2.

Effect of Personality on Affect Reactivity  Model 3, the reactivity model, was built to investigate whether the effect of daily stressors on the level of sadness depends on the personality traits, i.e. whether there is a statistical interaction between trait and stressor on the level of negative affect. In order to make the regression coefficients more intuitive, the results are reported as the interaction of personality traits and lower quality of daily incidents (i.e. daily stressors) on the level of sadness.  Neuroticism predicted higher reactivity of sadness to all of the assessed daily stressors (see results in Table 6 , see Figure 1 for illustration of selected associations). We found conscientiousness to predict lower reactivity to all of the daily stressors except negative solitude. Agreeableness predicted lower reactivity only to negatively evaluated social interaction. Openness predicted higher reactivity to most of the daily stressors.  10.1371/journal.pone.0110907.g001 Figure 1  The association of (a) neuroticism and (b) conscientiousness with reactivity to daily negative events.

The model was adjusted for gender, age and assessment device used.  The effect of being alone per se, without taking into account the subjective evaluation of the situation, was also tested, but no significant associations with personality features emerged.   Discussion  Our findings provide new information about the associations of the Five Factor personality traits with affective reactivity in daily life. Moreover, our findings contribute to the current knowledge of the associations between personality traits and average level of affect, affect variability and daily stressors.  The results for neuroticism were consistent with our primary hypothesis. They indicate that neuroticism not only is associated with the average level of affect, but has an impact on several processes of daily emotions. Most importantly, our findings support the somewhat debated view that neuroticism indicates higher affect reactivity in daily life [36] . The association of neuroticism with emotional reactivity has an intriguing link to depression. Previous studies have shown that neuroticism amplifies the depressogenic effect of stressful life events, i.e. the interaction of stressful life events and neuroticism predicts onset of depression [59] , [60] . A potential mediator for this could be the effect that neuroticism has on emotional reactivity to stressors, as observed here. Neuroticism not only exposes to stressors but indicates vulnerability to them in daily life. Based on our findings, we cannot discern whether neuroticism actually influences the amount of stressors or just the subjective evaluation of them, but we can state that more neurotic persons report more negative daily events and activities. Recurrent negative experiences can reinforce negative attributions and appraisals and vice versa; negative attributions and appraisals, as well as higher average level and reactivity of negative affect, can make a person more prone to stress exposure. Negative bias in information processing [61] as well as negative appraisal styles [28] have previously been linked to neuroticism. This combination of negative affective processes could predispose persons with high neuroticism to internalizing disorders.  Conscientiousness, as opposed to neuroticism, was the only trait that predicted lower reactivity to most of the assessed daily stressors. Expectedly, it also predicted a lower average level of negative affect. A recent meta-analysis showed conscientiousness to be the second most powerful trait correlating with internalizing disorders [2] . It has been argued that at least part of this correlation could be explained by the effect of psychopathology on personality since especially affective disorders can cause demoralization and negative self-efficacy, which can lead to lower conscientiousness scores [2] . In our study the subjects were healthy young students without psychopathology, which indicates that the association of conscientiousness with emotional processes exists in the absence of any psychiatric illness. We suggest the possibility that the emotional processes mediating the link between personality features and internalizing disorders could be a combination of high negative affect and high reactivity to daily stressors, which in our study was associated with neuroticism. The opposite combination, which in our study was associated with conscientiousness, could be protective. This proposition is speculative and investigating it empirically would require a different study design, preferably longitudinal and comparing healthy subjects to patients. However, our results do provide a new approach for investigating personality and etiology of psychiatric illnesses. One approach to “deconstruct” personality traits, as suggested by Ormel et al. [17] , is to consider them as combinations of differentially biased emotional processes that can be more specific vulnerability markers than the Five Factor traits themselves. It would be interesting to specifically investigate if, and how these combinations of daily emotional processes are associated with psychopathology, and if they can explain the link between personality and psychopathology.  This could also help to clarify the association of extraversion with depression, which, based on previous studies, remains modest and somewhat equivocal [2] . It has been suggested that in fact the positive affect facet of extraversion, but not the other facets, is linked to depression [62] . A higher level of positive affect has also been shown to decrease the effect of genetic vulnerability to depression [63] . In this study, we observed, as expected, the association of extraversion with higher positive affect, but not with negative affect or reactivity.  Agreeableness appeared to be specifically protective against the effect of social stressors, but not against other kinds of stressors (i.e. events, activities, and solitude). Persons with high agreeableness tend to appraise social situations more positively, and the trait seems to protect against the effect of stressful social situations on affective state. This can be a highly important and adaptive characteristic in modern society, which requires handling various social situations and values good social skills. Agreeableness has indeed been linked to happiness [27] and positive affect [25] as strongly as extraversion. Interestingly, however, a meta-analysis [2] found no significant link between agreeableness and psychopathology.  The same meta-analysis [2] found no correlation between openness and psychopathology. In our study, we did, however, observe an association between openness and higher reactivity to daily stressors. Openness, by definition, is related to being imaginative, esthetically reactive, creative, and artistic [45] , characteristics close to emotional sensitivity. In this sense, it is intuitively feasible that openness could also increase reactivity to daily stressors. Since openness does not have an impact on average level of negative affect, but only on reactivity, it could be speculated that reactivity as indicated by openness is adaptive, enhancing creativity and imaginativeness.  An important strength of our study is the ecological validity of the Experience Sampling Method, which allows real-time experiences in everyday life to be collected. The lack of recall bias is especially important because of the possible negative information bias related to neuroticism [61] . Using an electronic assessment device ensures real-time assessment and decreases the risk for recall bias relative to paper-and-pen ESM studies. The most important limitation of our study is that the study sample included only young, mostly female students who had been high achievers in school. This hinders generalization of the results to the general population. Evidence does exist about gender-specific genetic effects on neuroticism [10] and therefore our results cannot directly be generalized to male population. However, the study sample can also be seen as a strength since, as stated earlier, it enables evaluation of the emotional processes of healthy persons without the confounding effect of psychopathology. A uniform sample also minimizes other causes of variance, and therefore the observed effect is more likely due to personality differences. We assessed the effect of each personality dimension independently. Naturally, there can be some degree of correlation and/or interaction between the dimensions. Specifically, extraversion and neuroticism have been found to interact to predict positive and negative affect [64] . We observed no such interaction between extraversion and neuroticism, and this subject was not investigated further.   Conclusion  Our results indicate that personality features can influence several different daily emotional processes, i.e. average level, variability, subjective evaluation of daily incidents, and reactivity. Identifying these processes can shed light on individual differences in daily emotional life. This could help in the efforts to elucidate the link between personality and psychopathology. Our study, utilizing an ecologically valid method, shows that neuroticism has the broadest associations of all five features with daily emotional processes, predicting not only higher average level but also higher reactivity of negative affect. Conscientiousness predicted mostly the opposite. We suggest that reactivity of negative affect could have specific importance in terms of the link between personality features and depressive and anxiety disorders.

The Test of Emotional Intelligence (TIE) is a new ability scale based on a theoretical model that defines emotional intelligence as a set of skills responsible for the processing of emotion-relevant information. Participants are provided with descriptions of emotional problems, and asked to indicate which emotion is most probable in a given situation, or to suggest the most appropriate action. Scoring is based on the judgments of experts: professional psychotherapists, trainers, and HR specialists. The validation study showed that the TIE is a reliable and valid test, suitable for both scientific research and individual assessment. Its internal consistency measures were as high as .88. In line with theoretical model of emotional intelligence, the results of the TIE shared about 10% of common variance with a general intelligence test, and were independent of major personality dimensions.   This research was supported by a grant from Polish Ministry of Science and Higher Education (N N106 1063 36). The funder had no role in study design, data collection and analysis, decision to publish, or preparation of the manuscript. info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0103484.t006  Introduction   Emotional intelligence and its measurement  The concept of emotional intelligence (EI) entered psychological vocabulary more than 20 years ago [1] and quickly earned a high rank of popularity among researchers and practitioners. The original definition conceptualized it as “the ability to monitor one’s own and others’ feelings and emotions, to discriminate among them, and to use this information to guide one’s thinking and actions” ( [1] , p. 189). Because scientists assumed that this set of abilities explain important life outcomes [2] – [5] , they immediately began inventing various psychometric tools suitable for the measurement of EI as an individual trait. With time, the domain split in two assessment strategies. The first relies on self-report questionnaires, and the assumption that people know how well they understand and deal with emotions. According to this approach, EI is typically measured through self-judgments, using items of the form “I often find it difficult to show my affection to those close to me” or “I understand my emotions well.” Self-report questionnaires require thorough insight into one’s mental state based on accurate feedback regarding the accuracy of the emotional abilities, which seems not to be true in most cases [6] . The second assessment strategy uses ability tests based on performance criteria. They are supposed to reflect a person’s actual level of EI development. Although the tests seem much more objective and informative than questionnaires, they require more time and effort, both in the process of their construction and during administration. Another difficulty with the ability tests of EI pertains to the scoring criteria. In the realm of human emotions, problems rarely have only one “true” or “correct” solution; therefore, scoring procedures must be based either on the consensual approach (i.e., the most frequent answer is regarded “correct”) or on painstaking experts’ judgments [7] , [8] .  The aim of this paper is to introduce a new instrument for assessing emotional intelligence, labeled the Test of Emotional Intelligence ( Test Inteligencji Emocjonalnej , TIE). Our test is based on the theory developed by Peter Salovey and John Mayer [1] , [2] , [7] . According to this theory, EI involves a set of cognitive abilities used for processing emotionally relevant information. Specifically, the theory splits EI into four distinct, albeit correlated, abilities, also called “branches”: (a) Perception of Emotions, (b) Using Emotions to Facilitate Thinking, (c) Understanding Emotions, and (d) Managing Emotions [2] , [7] . The first ability (Perception of Emotions) consists of proper perception, identification, and recognition of emotions in one’s own subjective experience, as well as in other people’s behavior. The second dimension, labeled Using Emotions to Facilitate Thinking, pertains to the assimilation of emotions with thinking and problem solving. The third ability (Understanding Emotions) consists of proper understanding of emotions, including the comprehension of triggering factors, phases of the emotional process, and proper sequencing of emotional states. Finally, the management of emotions (Managing Emotions) is the ability to regulate one’s own emotional states, as well as the ability to deal with other people’s emotions and feelings.   TIE: objectives and assumptions  A number of authors argue that EI is important for social functioning and can predict educational achievement or job performance beyond intellectual ability and personality factors [3] , [9] – [13] . To explore these relationships, researchers and practitioners need psychometrically sound and conceptually comprehensive measures of EI. Although numerous methods of measurement have already been created [14] – [18] , each of the existing tools has some disadvantages. The shortcomings of these measures are different; for some tests it is their length, for others – their insufficient reliability, or the additional equipment needed. Even the Mayer–Salovey–Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test (MSCEIT) [16] , which seems the best validated performance measure to fully reflect the ability model of EI, cannot be applied without doubts, as it is not free from cultural specificity [19] . In general, the majority of all concise measures of EI are self-reports influenced by the respondents’ self-esteem and mood, and reflecting rather generalized social adaptation [20] than actual emotional skills, while the ability tests either require considerable time to administer or have limited conceptual coverage. Seeing that a perfect measure of EI has not been created so far, we believe that developing new tools is worthwhile, or even necessary. Both for research and diagnostic purposes, the collection of available tests should be systematically enriched and restored. Since culture can shape the experience and expression of emotions [21] , alternative measurement instruments should be developed and validated within different cultural groups. Consequently, our aim was to develop a valid and reliable instrument tapping multidimensional construct of EI, based on narratives and experiences from an adequate cultural context. Staying within scientific bounds in the use of such terms as emotion and intelligence we opt for the ability-based approach and assume that maximum performance tests are the best tools for assessing EI. Hence, we created a performance-based scale covering the whole set of emotional abilities, which is brief and easy to administer in individual and group settings.  Three assumptions have been made during the construction process of the TIE. First, we wanted to measure the actual abilities of people rather than their own opinions about themselves. The majority of people think that their own EI level is higher than the average [9] , therefore performance tests seem much more objective and valid than self-report questionnaires. Second, we intended to create an ecologically valid test, in which solutions would not be scored on the “zero-one” basis. Social and emotional problems are usually too complex and ambiguous to justify such an approach. Therefore, we deliberately decided to give participants the opportunity to rank response options according to their decreasing appropriateness rather than to classify them as “accurate” or “inaccurate”. Third, we decided to base the scoring criteria on experts’ judgment rather than on statistical distribution of the results in the population. Assuming that EI is an ability, or a set of abilities, rather than a personality trait or preference [22] – [24] , the most frequent test responses must be regarded as less appropriate than ones that are infrequent but produced by highly emotionally intelligent persons.   Aims of the study and research hypotheses  The aim of our empirical investigations was threefold. First, we intended to provide a detailed, in-depth look into the factorial structure of EI as measured with the TIE. In addition to the factor analyses, we planned to provide empirical data on TIE reliability and validity. To obtain this purpose, we assessed the test’s internal consistency and reported its relationships with established psychological measures, presenting both its convergent and divergent validity. Because ability tests of EI usually reveal systematic gender and age differences we also analyzed such group differences. Since the TIE is an ability measure of EI, in all cases we expected the results usually obtained for such methods. Below, we present the hypotheses in detail.   Factor structure of the TIE  As the test has been based directly on Mayer and Salovey’s four-factor model [2] , we first decided to test the factorial solutions endorsed by these authors for their MSCEIT [16] , i.e., one-, two- and four oblique-factor solutions. These solutions reflect the authors’ theoretical assumption that general EI (one-factor solution) consists of four branches (four-factor solution), that may be grouped in sets of two due to their functional similarity (two-factor solution): Experiential (perceiving and using emotions) and Strategic (understanding and managing emotions). Additionally, based on initial theoretical analyses and preliminary CFAs conducted for the TIE [25] , we propose and test an alternative area division with the abilities of perceiving and understanding emotions constituting the alternative Experiential area, and the abilities of using and managing comprising the new Strategic area.  More recent analyses of the MSCEIT (which remains our main standard of comparison, due to its reputation, popularity, and being the only instrument fully reflecting the ability model of EI) showed that alternative factorial solutions could be more adequate. Therefore, we added a nested modeling procedure endorsed by Palmer and colleagues [26] . This approach does not simply assume that some higher-order factors emerge from the lower-level sets of abilities. Instead, in line with the traditional model of intelligence introduced by Charles Spearman [27] , it suggests that test item performance (and, in consequence, life-situation performance) is “loaded” by two different factors: general (the famous “g” factor in intelligence) and specific for particular task/situation (“s” factors). Interestingly, Palmer and colleagues found that EI can also be recognized as a sort of “traditionally understood” intelligence, with one general EI factor, and specific branch-level factors. This observation led us to verify the “nested” (as Palmer calls them) models, to resolve this theoretical bifurcation. Summing up, we decided to test four oblique-factor models: one-factor, four-factor, and two versions of two-factor solutions (with an alternative distribution of subscales between the area-level factors). Further, we applied the “nested” strategy, again testing two versions of two-factor models, a four-factor model, and, additionally, a three-factor model endorsed by Palmer and colleagues [26] .   General Intelligence  If emotional intelligence indeed represents a kind of intelligence, tests of general mental ability should correlate with tests of EI; however, such correlation should not be very strong in order to exclude the possibility that both domains are impossible to discriminate [7] . Along with this assumption, numerous previous studies have demonstrated that EI, as measured by the ability tests, correlates at a very modest level (from .31 to .39) with verbal intelligence [7] , [12] , [28] – [30] . In the case of MSCEIT, most of the overlap with verbal intelligence is accounted for by the subscale of Understanding Emotions. Correlations with fluid intelligence are smaller but still significant [12] , [31] , [32] . We predict analogical results for the TIE.   Personality  The results concerning relationships between emotional intelligence and personality are ambiguous, mostly due to the fact that different EI measurement strategies produce different results. Conceptualizing emotional intelligence as a trait and assessing it with self-reports leads to considerable overlap between EI and the Big Five traits [33] – [35] . Not surprisingly, self-judgments of a trait described as a constellation of emotional self-perceptions [36] involving adaptability, assertiveness, social competence, and stress management [37] highly correlates with personality dimensions. Self-judgment scales assess variables relevant to motivation, social skills, and other areas of personality [12] , and thus, overlap with the Big Five sometimes as much as the different scales of the Big Five overlap with each other [22] . However, if we define EI as an ability, not a preference or inclination, we should not expect significant relationships with major personality dimensions. Whether or not people are sociable or assertive, they might be intelligent about emotions. Along with that claim, many empirical studies [9] , [12] , [28] , [30] show that ability-based EI shares only a small fraction of common variance with personality, if at all. For example, the MSCEIT correlated .25 with Openness and .28 with Agreeableness [12] . In line with these results, we predict that among five personality dimensions, the TIE would only have a modest relation to Agreeableness and Openness [38] .   Trait EI (self-report)  Empirical research systematically confirms that self-reported scales do not predict ability assessments of EI well. Correlations between measures of trait EI and ability EI are invariably low [39] showing that the former belong to the realm of personality, whereas the latter pertain to the domain of cognitive ability. In direct tests, self-judgment-based responses are not highly correlated with measured abilities of perceiving, using, understanding, and managing emotions. Therefore, we expect significant albeit weak correlations of self-reported EI with the results of the TIE.   Perception of emotions  Convergence among the most widely used ability test of EI (MSCEIT) and ability measures of emotional perception is rather low. For example, correlations between the MSCEIT and the Japanese and Caucasian Brief Affect Recognition Test [40] are no higher than r  = .18; with “facial blends” [41] reaching only r  = .14, while those of the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test [42] reach r  = .56. The first studies using the TIE show significant relationships between its results and the ability measure of emotional perception. Wojciechowski and colleagues [43] found that all four TIE branch scores were significantly correlated with the results of a computer test measuring individual effectiveness in recognizing facial expressions (The Face Decoding Test, FDT). Analyses revealed a systematic pattern of positive relationships between the TIE and FDT, with Pearson’s r ranging between .20 and .38, all significant at p <.01. We expect similar results in this study.   Gender  Although studies based on self-reports bring disparate findings concerning gender differences in EI [11] , [14] , , when performance indicators of EI are used, clear and repetitive results are observable: women score higher than men, and these differences are sometimes as huge as one standard deviation [4] , [9] . We expect similar gender differences (with females scoring higher) in the present study.   Age  According to the theory, EI should increase with age due to the accumulation of knowledge about emotion and its social context [46] . Nevertheless, studies designed to confirm this effect bring mixed results. Some researchers report significantly better scores on all four EI branches for older adults [7] , some investigators [46] show older adults outperform younger participants on three out of four EI dimensions (no difference in perceiving emotions), while others – find no significant association between age and ability EI [47] , [48] or even negative correlation between age and emotional perception [26] , [49] . Most recently [50] it has been found that older people have lower scores than younger people for total EI and for perceiving, facilitating, and understanding emotions, whereas age is not associated with managing emotions.  Visibly, according to some studies, EI grows with time, but in agreement with the others it declines with age as any other cognitive ability. Paradoxically, it might not be a contradiction. Probably, from childhood, through adolescence, until middle and old age people develop emotional abilities and gather the experiences building their EI. Inevitable age-related cognitive decline happens only in very old age and does not equally affect all aspects of EI. It seems that older people have difficulty perceiving emotions [51] , but may outperform younger people in managing emotions. Therefore, we expect small albeit significant age related gains in each EI branch until middle age, and a small decline for the subscales of perceiving, using and understanding emotions (but not managing) for the oldest participants. Thus, for the three branches a quadratic relationship with age is hypothesized, whereas for the fourth one we anticipate a systematic linear growth across the lifespan.   Method   Ethical Statement  The study was approved by the ethics committee of the Institute of Psychology, the Jagiellonian University in Krakow. Participants provided written informed consent. In the case of participants under 18, written informed consent was obtained both from the participant and the guardian.   Participants  We analyzed data from 4642 people, combining about 30 studies conducted by our team and collaborators with broad experience in empirical research. Participants volunteered for studies with either no or little compensation (course credits or money). There were 2664 females and 1673 males in the sample (missing N = 305). The mean age of the sample was 25.47 ( SD  = 9.15, range 16–67). There were 644 high-school students, 1726 university students, and 773 employees in the sample (missing N = 1499). The structure of education in the sample of employees was as follows: primary N = 23, vocational N = 33, secondary N = 227, higher N = 247 (missing N = 243).   Measures   Ability test of EI  Emotional intelligence was measured with the TIE. The test consists of four subtests representing consecutively Perception , Understanding , Facilitation , and Management of emotions (four labels of TIE subscales are slightly different from the labels of MSCEIT, but they pertain to the same theoretical model). Each subtest is defined by six item parcels. An item parcel consists of one problem situation in which people perceive, experience, manifest or use emotions, followed by three alternative responses. This is an example of such item parcel:  Sophie hits the table with a fist. She frowns, her face is glowing, and her teeth are clenched. Most probably:   a) She is watching a popular show on TV   1 …… 2 …… 3 …… 4 …… 5   b) Once again she hurt her finger while cutting bread   1 …… 2 …… 3 …… 4 …… 5   c) She was just told by a colleague that he will not help her to prepare an important project, because he is leaving for a last-minute holiday   1 …… 2 …… 3 …… 4 …… 5.   The three answers are related to the same emotional problem, however, each of them asks about the accuracy of a different strategy or perception, and therefore they can be treated as separate items. The whole test consists of two parts with different instructions. In the first part, referring to Perception and Understanding , participants are asked to reflect on feelings and thoughts of persons who were involved in the described situations. The task is to evaluate, on a 5-point Likert scale anchored at the ends with a “very bad answer” and a “very good answer,” the probability that a person involved in the situation experiences alternative emotions. In the second part, referring to Facilitation and Management , test-takers are asked to indicate the most advisable action that a protagonist should implement in order to solve the problem. The task is to judge, on a similar 5-point Likert scale, the level of appropriateness of each of the three actions described on the answer sheet, ranging from “very ineffective” to “very effective.” Scoring is based on the similarity of a testee’s responses with answers provided by the panel of experts (52 professionals, including 13 psychotherapists, 14 trainers of management, and 25 HR specialists). The points are summed up separately for all branches and for the whole test.   Self-reported EI  Self-reported EI was assessed via the SSEIT [18] , a brief scale based on Salovey and Mayer’s [2] original definition of EI. Individuals are instructed to give their level of agreement to 33 statements describing different aspects of emotional life (e.g., “I know why my emotions change”) on a scale ranging from 1 (strongly agree) to 5 (strongly disagree). The original English version adapted to Polish [52] in this research reached an internal consistency of .91.   Perception of emotions  The ability of perceiving emotions in nonverbal signals was measured with the SIE-T, an instrument tapping the ability to recognize emotions in facial expressions [53] . The internal consistency was .84.   Fluid intelligence  Raven’s Advanced Progressive Matrices–RAPM [54] , showing an internal consistency of .87, served as a tool to evaluate fluid intelligence.   Verbal intelligence  The test based on Horn and Cattell’s [55] theory of crystallized intelligence served as a tool for assessing verbal intelligence. The participants are asked to classify 120 words to one of the following categories: (1) art, (2) biology, (3) science, (4) literature, or (5) geography and history. The score is calculated as the number of correct answers given in five minutes.   Personality  To assess personality dimensions, we employed NEO-FFI [56] , [57] showing the following internal consistencies (α): .77, .68, .82, .80, and .68 for Extraversion, Agreeableness, Conscientiousness, Neuroticism, and Openness to Experience, respectively.   Procedure  Since the TIE is a paper-and-pencil test, it was possible to gather the data in small groups, normally not exceeding 10 persons. The participants worked in quiet settings, completing the test in a limited time of 30 minutes. Other instruments were administered according to standard instructions, usually after the participants completed the TIE test. The entire study lasted for 1 to 2 hours.   Results  The main analyses (descriptive statistics, factor structure) were accomplished using the whole sample. For other analyses (convergent and discriminant validity), we took into account those participants who completed relevant tests or questionnaires (e.g., RAPM or NEO-FFI).   Descriptive statistics  Table 1 provides basic descriptive statistics for four subscales and the total score of the TIE. The results are slightly negatively skewed, although neither skewness nor kurtosis indicators exceed an absolute value of 1.0, thus the score distributions may be treated as approximately normally distributed. Since neither floor nor ceiling effects can be discerned, it seems that the TIE provides enough space for assessment of individual differences in EI.  10.1371/journal.pone.0103484.t001 Table 1  Descriptive statistics.

We investigated eight models, in groups of four. The first group was tested using an oblique-factor modeling strategy: the four-factor model, based on the underlying theory of EI, the one-factor model, assuming the existence of the general EI factor, and two versions of the two-factor solution. The first (Two-factor A, Table 2 ) corresponds to the area division by Mayer and Salovey [2] . The second version (Two-factor B, Table 2 ) corresponds to the results obtained in the pilot study [25] in which Perception and Understanding entered the first factor, whereas the dimensions of Facilitation and Management formed the second.  10.1371/journal.pone.0103484.t002 Table 2  Exact and close-fit statistics/indices (WLS) for TIE models.

The second group of models was analyzed using a nested factor modeling strategy [26] . In addition, in this case we tested a four-factor model and 2 two-factor solutions, as well as the novel model with three nested factors, endorsed by Palmer and colleagues. For the analyses we applied weighted least squares (WLS) estimation method. All solutions obtained an acceptable goodness of fit indicators ( Table 2 ). Although the A and B two-factor models simply cannot be compared with each other due to an equal number of degrees of freedom, it seems obvious from all the applied fit indices that the solution proposed by the authors of the test (i.e., “B” model) is, in case of the TIE, definitely better than the original area division proposed by Mayer and Salovey [2] . The difference is visible both in traditional and nested factor modeling. For the oblique-factor group of models, the four-factor and two-factor “B” solutions revealed the lowest χ 2 /df ratio, i.e., proved to be the best fit-to-data. A comparison of the two models revealed supremacy of the four-factor model ( χ 2 diff  = 40.02, df diff  = 5, p <.001) presented in Table 3 .  10.1371/journal.pone.0103484.t003 Table 3  TIE standarized parameter estimates (WLS) for oblique-factor (Model 4) and nested factor (Models 6 and 8) models (N = 4642).

The nested factor modeling strategy [26] resulted in a better fit to model in each of the analyzed cases, with all models significantly better fit in the nested version. Adding the “g” EI factor significantly improves the analyzed models’ fitness. Using the nested modeling strategy we have also confirmed the advantage of the four-factor solution over the two-factor “B” model ( χ 2 diff  = 49.85, df diff  = 7, p <.001). These two models revealed the highest fit indices, surpassing the three nested factors solution that proved most appropriate in the case of MSCEIT ( χ 2 diff  = 43.18, df diff  = 3, and χ 2 diff  = 93.03, df diff  = 10, respectively for two- and four-factor models; both significant at p <.001). Altogether, the CFA results suggest that the four-factor and two-factor “B” structures with nested factors should be preferred over the competing models.  Based on the goodness of fit indices reported above, we chose the three models to present their factor loadings ( Table 3 ). Note that in model 8, the Facilitation factor loadings become negative, suggesting that the model may be overestimated. The case is similar to the nested two-factor model analyzed by Palmer and colleagues [26] . Albeit their model had an excellent fit, it was considered unacceptable. Therefore, model 8 must be treated with high caution, even if it seems adequate when analyzed using oblique modeling. It is interesting that exactly as in the Mayer–Salovey–Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test [16] , Facilitation proved to be the “black sheep” of EI abilities. In all, the two-factor “B” model in its nested version seems the most reliable solution with respect to the factorial structure of the TIE.  The correlational analyses revealed that four subscales of the TIE are mutually intercorrelated and strongly related to the total score ( Table 4 ).  10.1371/journal.pone.0103484.t004 Table 4  Correlations between TIE subscales and the total score.

Reliability  The overall TIE reliability is r  = .88. For the subscales, Cronbach’s alphas are: .70 ( Perception ), .69 ( Understanding ), .65 ( Facilitation ), .66 ( Management ). Additionally, we computed reliability indices for two parts of the test. For the first part ( Perception and Understanding ) Cronbach’s alpha is .81, and the respective value for the second part ( Facilitation and Management ), is .78. Coefficient alpha of the total score is adequate, reliabilities associated with the branch level scales are less satisfactory, although such estimates are common among tests in this area of research [41] , [59] , [60] .   Validity  We adopted several ways to evaluate the validity of the TIE (see Table 5 ). First, we looked at the discriminant validity, using two IQ tests. The total score of the TIE correlated with RAPM (N = 912) at the level of r  = .35, p <.001, indicating a medium effect size [61] and with the G c test (N = 474) at the level of r  = .26, p <.001 (small effect size). The highest correlations with fluid and crystallized intelligence tests reached the subscale of Understanding (.37 and .36, respectively; medium effect size), which is consistent with the results reported by other researchers [60] . The remaining correlation coefficients ranged between .15 and .29. These medium strength intercorrelations suggest that EI, as measured with the TIE, and general intelligence are separate albeit interconnected mental abilities.  10.1371/journal.pone.0103484.t005 Table 5  Correlations between TIE scores and measures considered for the validity examination.

To evaluate the discriminant validity of the TIE we analyzed its relation to NEO-FFI. In our study (N = 511), only Agreeableness correlated with TIE’s subscales (coefficients ranged between .11 and .14, p <.01) and the total score ( r  = .16, p <.01), revealing a small effect size according to Cohen [61] . These correlations were weak, explaining about 2.5% of common variance, at the most. Thus, our test proved its independence of personality, similarly to other ability measures of EI based on performance criteria, such as MSCEIT [30] .  Looking at the convergent validity of the TIE, we found that the total score of the TIE correlated with the SSEIT at a significant but low level ( r  = .16, p <.001, N = 648). As to the subscales, the correlation coefficient with SSEIT was insignificant for Understanding , while for others ranged from r  = .11, p <.01 ( Perception ) to r  = .18, p <.01 ( Facilitation ), thus only oscillating around the threshold of a small effect size [61] . The correlations between the TIE and the SIE-T were higher than with the SSEIT ( r  = .35, p <.001, N = 631), ranging from r  = .26, p <.01 ( Perception ) to r  = .37, p <.01 ( Understanding ) at the subscale level, showing medium effect sizes [61] . The self-report measure of EI revealed weaker relationships with the TIE than the ability test, despite the fact the latter referred to only one specific aspect of EI, namely: recognition of expressions of emotions.  The validity of an EI test can be evaluated not only via correlating its results with other instruments of the same kind, but also through analysis of group differences. In our study, women outperformed men in every subscale of the TIE, and consequently in the total score ( Table 6 ). All differences are highly significant and the effect sizes are remarkable.  10.1371/journal.pone.0103484.t006 Table 6  Gender differences in TIE: subscales and total score (N = 4369).

Standard deviations are indicated in parentheses. d–Cohen’s effect size indicator.  In case of the TIE, the effect of age was also confirmed. The correlation coefficient between age and the general TIE score was r  = .05, p <.001 (N = 4530). The effect was similar for three out of four of TIE branch scores, with Pearson’s r s of .04, p <.01 for Perception , .05, p <.01 for Understanding , and .06, p <.001 for Management . Only for Facilitation the correlation with age was not significant, r  = .02, p  = .12. These results are in line with conclusions formulated by Mayer, Caruso, and Salovey [7] . Although the effect is very small and does not reach the small effect size threshold proposed by Cohen [61] , it does not differ from EI-age correlations obtained for MSCEIT [26] . We did not find any evidence supporting the formulated claims on curvilinear changes in EI branches across the lifespan.   Discussion  The main aim of the present study was to test the psychometric properties and factor structure of the new ability test of EI. We assumed that TIE’s results would conform to the theoretical assumptions of the four-branch structure of EI, specified by Mayer and Salovey [22] . Most of the formulated hypotheses were confirmed.  The TIE proved its suitability as a reliable test of emotional intelligence. The internal consistency measures were rather high, as far as the total score is concerned, or mostly acceptable, if the particular subscales are taken into account. The internal consistency score at the level of .88 is a result very similar to the one usually found concerning Raven’s Matrices [54] or the MSCEIT [41] , [62] , [63] , the most widely used tests of IQ and EI. Reliabilities associated with the subscales of the TIE were smaller, although such estimates are not unique among tests in this area of research. To point out only a few examples concerning MSCEIT: Caruso [64] reported a Cronbach’s of .74 (Understanding Emotions) and .76 (Managing Emotions), Roberts et al. [60] revealed .67 (Using Emotions to Facilitate Thinking), .68 (Understanding Emotions), and .68 (Managing Emotions). More recently, Austin [41] showed .58 (Using Emotions to Facilitate Thinking), .66 (Understanding Emotions), and .66 (Managing Emotions); and finally, Lopes and colleagues in one of their studies [65] obtained for Managing Emotions a split-half reliability of .57. Because of the fact that reliability measures concerning subscales of the TIE do not differ substantially from other tools of this kind [66] , both the total and subscales may be used in the research, while for individual diagnosis it seems advisable to rely on the total score.  The results of the TIE conform to the theoretical assumptions about the nature and structure of EI, specified by Mayer and Salovey [2] , [7] , [22] . This finding is good both for the theory, as its empirical support, and for the test, as an argument for its theoretical validity. At the same time, our study suggests that the between-branch connections may be conceptualized in a different manner than in the original theory. In Mayer and colleagues’ original conceptualization, perceiving and using emotions formed the experiential factor, whereas understanding and managing emotions loaded the factor of strategy [16] . This division is based on an observation that some emotional abilities enhance emotional knowledge and make one “closer” to one’s own and others’ emotions, and therefore comprise the “hotter” part of EI, whereas other abilities are usually treated as useful tools for “cold,” strategic regulation of emotion. However, this division of abilities remains a problematic issue. Whereas perception is clearly experiential, and management is definitely strategic, the understanding and facilitation branches are much more ambiguous. The former is manifested mainly in adequate labeling of emotions, as well as linking them with their causes and consequences. Accurate labeling is necessary for differentiation of similar emotional states; thus, to distinguish two different albeit similar affective states one needs to accurately feel these states, which makes the understanding branch experiential, at least to some degree. On the other hand, facilitation, also labeled “using emotion to facilitate thought” [2] , [7] , has much in common with processes of meta-cognitive control, and thus remains a very “applicable” and therefore strategic dimension.  Our results imply that the Perception branch may be in fact situated closer to Understanding than Facilitation , while the latter seems to be more strongly connected to Management than to Understanding . This finding can lead to modification of Salovey and Mayer’s theory. Nevertheless, we suggest this interpretation with caution, realizing that our outcomes may result either from specific operationalization of respective branches of EI or from cultural specificity. However, our findings are generally consistent with the underlying theoretical assumptions and empirical data concerning the structure of emotional intelligence as a set of four abilities.  Confirmatory Factor Analyses revealed that although four-factor models were characterized with the best fit indices, they should be treated with caution due to unexpected negative loadings of Facilitation branch. Therefore, the two factor solution with general-EI loading on each area seems much less ambiguous, and, in the light of the presented data, should be preferred over the remaining ones. The supremacy of the nested models suggests that EI, as measured with the TIE, has much more to do with intelligence (in the way in which Charles Spearman would want to see it, as loaded with general and specific factors), than with personality. Thereby, we provide further evidence for “the intelligence of EI” [7] , based not only on the test’s convergent/divergent validity, but also on its factorial structure.  Many studies introducing new EI methods face the problem of weak convergent validity. Our results seem to be in line with the empirical data published to date. The total score of the TIE correlated with self-reported EI at a significant but low level oscillating around the threshold of a small effect size [61] . Taking into account that both tools are based on the same theoretical model, one might expect much higher correlations, although such result is not an exception. The most elegant example was provided by Brackett and colleagues [9] , who developed a self-judgment scale based on the Four-Branch Model and found a correlation of only r  = 0.19 with the MSCEIT. More commonly used self-judgment scales of EI, such as Bar-On’s EQ-i [14] or the SSEIS [18] predict MSCEIT results better, but still at a pretty low level [12] , [67] . MacCann and Roberts’s Situational Test of Emotional Understanding and Situational Test of Emotional Management [68] correlated with MSCEIT of .33 and .36, respectively. A very similar correlation of .36 has been found between the TIE and the PKIE, a self-reported measure of EI [69] . The problem of very low correlations between different measures of EI undoubtedly stems from inconsistences on a theoretical and psychometric level, and leads to the conclusion that self-assessed EI and ability EI measured by performance tests are different constructs.  Despite the disparate forms of measurement methods, the correlations of the TIE and an instrument tapping the ability to recognize emotions in facial expressions were higher, revealing medium effect sizes [61] . As significant relations cannot be assigned to shared method variance in this case, such result provides support for the construct’s convergent validity.  Compared with the convergent validity evidence, the discriminant validity evidence for the TIE is promising. According to the ability-based approach, emotional intelligence is not a personality trait, and thus its measures should not share much variance with major personality dimensions. Many empirical studies [9] , [12] , showed that EI shares only a small fraction of common variance with personality. In line with that, the TIE proved its independence of personality. Weak, although significant, correlations with Agreeableness, and the lack of any other relationships with the remaining Big Five dimensions, should be interpreted as evidence that the TIE does not cover preferences, habits, or inclinations. The very moderate correlations between the TIE and measures of general intelligence suggest that EI is a set of mental abilities, related to intelligence, but quite independent of it. These findings are also consistent with EI literature [32] , [60] , [66] , [70] .  Most tests of ability EI reveal systematic gender differences. Research proves that women tend to show greater knowledge of emotional experiences, provide more complex descriptions about emotions, and use a broader emotional vocabulary [71] – [73] , and thus consequently regularly score higher than men on EI ability tests [4] , [9] . Also in our study, women outperformed men in every single subscale of TIE, and consequently in the total score (with remarkable effect sizes). Such confirmation of the generally recognized phenomenon of women’s advantage concerning emotional abilities is additional evidence supporting the new test’s validity.  According to Mayer and Salovey’s theory, EI should increase with age due to the accumulation of knowledge about emotion and its social context [7] , [46] . Our results are in line with such prediction. Although the effect is small, it does not differ from EI-age correlations obtained for MSCEIT [26] . Since our sample did not include participants older than 70, we did not discover age-related cognitive decline in EI.   Conclusions  Although it is impossible to provide exhaustive psychometric evidence for a new measure in one study, the results of the present investigation are encouraging. In general, our findings are consistent with prior studies on EI ability measures. The TIE meets psychometric standards concerning reliability, theoretical validity (factorial structure), and discriminant validity. Undeniably, the results for convergent validity seem less satisfactory, although such problem is widespread in this domain of research. Convergent validity of EI measures remains a controversial topic and continually elicits lively debate among EI researchers. A significant limitation of our study is the fact that we did not use the MSCEIT to prove convergence between two performance tests. Definitely, a high correlation between the MSCEIT and the TIE would be adequate evidence for the convergent validity of the latter. Unfortunately, the MSCEIT is not available in Poland, and hence such analyses were unattainable.  The present empirical investigation involved more than 4000 participants from different populations and applied the most widely used measures of human personality and intelligence. Nevertheless, it only provides the groundwork for subsequent systematic research. The evidence for the validity of the TIE will probably arise from multiple studies with diverse samples and a variety of theoretically related criteria. In future studies, the TIE should be validated against other measures of emotional abilities and indicators of predictive validity which hopefully show how individuals with higher (and lower) EI handle situations in which emotions play an important role.  Further progress in the measurement of EI is undoubtedly required. In our opinion, future studies should provide an in-depth look into the true nature of “general” EI. Usually, EI is treated as a simple sum of the four branch scores, reflecting the four elementary groups of emotional abilities. However, the supremacy of nested models revealed in the present paper, suggest that the issue is more complex. It appears that a general, unspecific mental-emotional capacity does exist. It loads each of the particular branches, but cannot be reduced to their sum. This conclusion could be a starting point for a revision of the established ability EI model, so that this set of emotional skills “behaves” in a way consistent with how Spearman described “traditional” intelligence, with each performance loaded with both a general factor and specific factor(s).  The TIE has been developed as an alternative ability measure of emotional intelligence. Our aim was to create a valid and reliable instrument to tap the multidimensional construct of EI, which does not require considerable time to administer, and is easy to use for scientific and practical purposes. We believe that this goal has been accomplished. The TIE is useful and valuable because it incorporates a distinctive set of characteristics. Most of the existing EI measures present only one or two of those qualities, while the TIE has it all. First, it displays the advantages of the performance tests by measuring actual abilities of emotional perception and reasoning, not motivations, personality, or self-esteem. In comparison to other ability scales, it covers the whole spectrum of emotional abilities, fully reflecting the theoretical model of EI. In comparison to the MSCEIT, finally, which also meets the above criteria, TIE is shorter, easier to administer and based on a different cultural context. That being the case, we hope the TIE will enrich the collection of available EI tests and will serve to advance the domain.

Background  The relationships between positive and negative emotional experience and physical and psychological well-being have been well-documented. The present study examines the prospective positive relationship between concurrent positive and negative emotional experience and psychological well-being in the context of psychotherapy.    Methods  47 adults undergoing psychotherapy completed measures of psychological well-being and wrote private narratives that were coded by trained raters for emotional content.    Results  The specific concurrent experience of happiness and sadness was associated with improvements in psychological well-being above and beyond the impact of the passage of time, personality traits, or the independent effects of happiness and sadness. Changes in mixed emotional experience preceded improvements in well-being.    Conclusions  Experiencing happiness alongside sadness in psychotherapy may be a harbinger of improvement in psychological well-being.   The present study was funded by a grant from the Foley Family Foundation to Dan P. McAdams at Northwestern University, who oversaw data collection but was not involved in study design, data analysis, or preparation of this manuscript. The funders had no role in study design, data collection and analysis, decision to publish, or preparation of the manuscript.   info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0035633.t004   Introduction  The respective benefits and drawbacks of positive and negative emotional experience on physical and psychological well-being have been well documented [1] – [3] . Yet, considerably less attention has been given to the ways in which the experience of mixed emotions – that is, the concurrent experience of positive and negative emotions – can affect well-being. A notable exception is the co-activation model of health proposed by Larsen and colleagues [4] , which holds that experiencing positive emotions concurrently with negative emotions may detoxify them, transforming a negative emotional experience into fodder for meaning-making and subsequently enhanced well-being. Although recent work has tested the postulates of Larsen's model on physical health [5] , very little research to date has directly examined the connection between mixed emotional experience and enhanced psychological well-being. In the present study, we investigated whether mixed emotional experience – specifically the concurrent experience of happiness and sadness – prospectively benefits improvement in psychological well-being. The context for this investigation was a naturalistic longitudinal study of psychotherapy in an outpatient clinic. Psychotherapy is fundamentally concerned with emotional experience [6] and provided an opportunity to assess the unfolding relationships between mixed emotional experience and psychological well-being. The present study aims to demonstrate that concurrent happiness and sadness may temporally precede improvements in psychological well-being in the context of psychotherapy. While this emphasis necessarily restricts the generalizability of this study to the psychotherapeutic context, the current work may have implications for the basic scientific understanding of mixed emotional experience as well as for influencing psychotherapeutic practice.   The role of mixed emotions in psychological well-being outcomes  When facing negative events in the course of one's life, people may choose to either suppress negative emotions [7] or express them [8] . There are benefits and drawbacks to both approaches, but failing to confront negative events can ultimately lead to increased stress levels [9] . Larsen and colleagues [4] propose that a third strategy, one of “taking the good with the bad,” might actually benefit individuals during difficult times by allowing them to confront adversity and ultimately find meaning in life's stressors (a eudaimonic outcome), as well as to feel better in their wake (a hedonic outcome). In their co-activation model, allowing for the experience of positive emotion alongside negative emotion prompts individuals to face negative life events and gain insight into them.  Larsen and colleagues' [4] model thus suggests that during difficult situations, a mix of positive and negative emotions may be optimal for well-being. For instance, when experiencing the loss of a loved one, allowing positive memories to be experienced alongside sadness could potentially lead to a healthier bereavement process [10] . As Davis and colleagues [11] note, one key to resilience across the adult life span, may be the “ability to maintain affective complexity in the face of life's inevitable difficulties” (p. 1155).  Zautra and colleagues' research on the Dynamic Model of Affect (DMA) [12] , [13] also speaks to this relationship. Namely, the DMA holds that when people are feeling calm, they process information from a variety of sources so as to create a balanced and rich assessment of their environments; benefits can be accrued from gaining a full understanding of contexts and experiences. However, when individuals are in the midst of difficult and uncertain situations, the need to process information in a quick and rapid fashion ultimately takes precedence over any advantages that might result from a more nuanced assessment of a situation. In such circumstances, attention narrows so that one can deal with immediate concerns, an idea that resonates with Fredrickson's Broaden-and-Build theory of positive emotions [14] . Generally, the DMA suggests that difficult life situations will tend to cause emotional experience to be much less complex than comparatively less difficult situations. There are, however, individual differences in the extent to which people experience affective complexity in the face of negative situations [12] . Theoretically, just as people experience some degree of affective complexity in calm states to gain a fuller understanding of their environments [11] , it stands to reason that those individuals who are better able to maintain this mixture of positive and negative emotion during difficult times will be better able to learn from life's ups and downs, and ultimately show enhanced psychological well-being.  Along these lines, Bonnano and Keltner [15] have found that bereaved adults who expressed positive emotions when talking about their recently deceased spouse (during what was an otherwise negative grieving period) experienced reduced grief over time. Perhaps most directly related to the present research, Coifman, Bonanno, and Rafaeli [16] found that participants who showed a less severe negative correlation between positive and negative emotions also evidenced greater resilience to loss. Furthermore, Ong and colleagues [17] showed that experiencing higher levels of positive emotion on stressful days was related to successful adaptation among widows in later life. Thus, the body of literature on mixed emotional experience outside the clinical context suggests that the concurrent experience of positive and negative emotions is positively associated with psychological well-being. Drawing on previous research that has focused on happiness and sadness specifically [18] , [19] , including Lazarus' [20] proposal that these are emblematic positive and negative emotions, in the current study we operationalized mixed emotions as a mix of happiness and sadness.  Psychotherapy is fundamentally concerned with emotional experience. Regardless of the specific approach to treatment, all psychotherapies grapple with patients' emotions as they relate to psychological well-being [6] . For example, exposure therapies for anxiety disorders seek to activate patients' negative emotion (anxiety) in controlled experiences in the service of promoting habituation and cognitive restructuring around the meaning of negative emotion [20] . Likewise, positive psychotherapy [21] – [23] suggests that depression can be addressed not only through a reduction of negative emotions, but also through the building of positive emotions, personal meaning, and character strengths. Different approaches to treatment adopt different strategies for eliciting and addressing emotions, but given that the literature on patients' perspectives on treatments suggests that the individuals undergoing treatment are most attuned to those elements of psychotherapy that transcend differences between theoretical orientations [21] , [22] , we focused on a variety of treatments in a natural context. Thus, the present study sought to examine the associations between mixed emotional experience and psychological well-being in the context of psychotherapy as it is practiced in typical treatment settings.    What is psychological well-being?  The small group of studies that have specifically investigated the relationship between mixed emotional experience and psychological well-being has implicitly embraced a multi-faceted notion of well-being, including both hedonic and eudaimonic elements [15] , [17] . Ryan and Deci [24] suggest that hedonic conceptions of psychological well-being tend to emphasize three dimensions: life satisfaction, the presence of positive affect, and the absence of negative affect. In contrast, eudaimonic conceptions of psychological well-being emphasize self-actualization and vitality [24] , [25] . It is important, though perhaps unsurprising, that mixed emotional experience might be associated with hedonic well-being, given that both are centrally concerned with affect. However mixed emotional experience might also be associated with eudaimonic well-being. In the present study we adopt a holistic operationalization of psychological well-being that taps both hedonic and eudaimonic dimensions. As a result, we employ the more general term, “psychological well-being,” to encompass this approach.    Overview of present research  Taken together, the studies reviewed above offer preliminary evidence for the positive role that the blending of positive and negative emotion can play in psychological well-being. Yet, none has systematically examined the prospective benefits that mixed emotions may have on psychological well-being over time in a fine-grained way. That is, while the above studies showed associations between mixed emotions and improved psychological well-being, none showed that mixed emotional experience (and concurrent happiness and sadness in particular) could be linked to improved psychological well-being in a longitudinal sense or examined the time course of these relationships. Furthermore, the existing research on mixed emotional experience has largely overlooked psychotherapy as a prime natural experiment for investigating the dynamic relationships between mixed emotions and psychological well-being. Thus, in the present study, we sought to examine whether mixed emotional experiences are prospectively linked to enhanced psychological well-being in the context of psychotherapy. Just as these other studies sought to produce results that might generalize beyond their specific focus on the experience of bereavement and loss, in the present study we have focused on psychotherapy as a paradigmatic example of an experience concerned with emotion. In doing so, we attempted to maximize ecological validity by longitudinally tracking a diverse sample of individuals undergoing psychotherapy who were engaged in varied processes of actively coping with adversity [6] , [26] – [28] . Although there is a wealth of research on session-by-session change in psychotherapy [29] – [31] , this previous work has not specifically examined the complex interplay between positive and negative emotion and its effect on therapy patients' psychological well-being. By examining participants on a session-by-session basis in the present study, we are able to evaluate the role that mixed emotional experience plays in therapeutic change.  We hypothesized that among psychotherapy participants 1) the concurrent experience of happiness and sadness would be associated with higher levels of psychological well-being over time, and 2) the concurrent experience of happiness and sadness would be prospectively linked to increases in psychological well-being.     Methods   Participants  Forty-seven adults ( M age  = 36 years) who sought treatment at a major outpatient clinic for a wide variety of problems, ranging from significant psychopathology to more typical life events such as divorce or the transition to parenthood, were enrolled in the present study prior to beginning treatment. Participants were eligible to participate if they were over 18 years old and seeking individual (as opposed to couple, family, or group) psychotherapy. There were no other exclusion criteria. Demographic description of the sample of participants can be found in Table 1 . Demographic description of the therapists who had patients enrolled in this study can be found in Table 2 . The sample was similar to that found in the general treatment-seeking population [32] .  10.1371/journal.pone.0035633.t001 Table 1  Demographic characteristics of sample (participants).

Many therapists responded to the open-ended probe with one of these labels. In the four instances where therapists instead described the specific techniques they used, an attempt was made to classify the treatment into one of these categories (three were labeled Integrative; one was labeled Cognitive-Behavioral). The distribution of theoretical orientation sums to 38, although there were 32 therapists, because some therapists used different primary theoretical orientations with different patients enrolled in the study.      Materials   Assessing psychological well-being  In order to tap a broad conception of psychological well-being encompassing both hedonic and eudaimonic elements [24] , the Systemic Therapy Inventory of Change was selected as the primary outcome measure (STIC) [33] – [36] . The STIC, a self-report questionnaire, is the first and only measure specifically designed to bring a multi-systemic perspective to the study of patient change in individual therapy [35] . The STIC offers several benefits, compared to other commonly used measures, including its holistic assessment of participants' psychological well-being, as well as its systemic perspective which assesses the participant and his or her greater relational context. In the present study, the STIC subscale specifically designed to assess changes in the patient's overall individual psychological well-being (the Individual Problems and Strengths (IPS) subscale) served as the primary index. In both the initial and intersession versions of the STIC this 24-item subscale shows good convergent validity with widely used measures of depression and anxiety [35] , [36] . On this subscale, participants respond to questions that tap hedonic well-being, such as “How well have you been getting along emotionally these days” and those that tap eudaimonic well-being, such as “I am comfortable with who I am,” along 5-point scales ranging from 1 to 5, where higher scores indicate more positive well-being.    Assessing personality traits  In addition to the STIC, participants also completed the Big Five Inventory (BFI), a widely-used measure of broad dispositional personality traits, two of which – neuroticism and extraversion – have long been shown to be associated with emotional experience [37] , [38] . An assessment of personality traits was included in the present investigation in order to ensure that any changes observed in participants' use of mixed-emotional language and their psychological well-being were not simply reducible to dispositional affective tendencies.    Assessing emotional experience  To assess the emotional content of participants' experiences, we collected private narratives about participants' perspectives on treatment. The present study asked participants to reflect in writing on their thoughts and feelings associated with being in therapy, including the way they saw the treatment fitting into their overall life or sense of self. As such, the narratives discussed both participants' life events as well as their experiences in treatment. They therefore concerned the way participants were working through the difficulties that brought them into treatment as well as the impact of that treatment on their sense of self. For example, here is an excerpt from one participant whose narrative features both happiness and sadness in discussing her treatment:   I am committed to trying to make every day better than the day before. So far, it's been tough going at times, with frequent setbacks involving much sadness and feelings of helplessness at times. But the fact that I'm working on improving in and of itself makes me feel better about my future and makes me happy and hopeful despite my slow progress and often listless feeling.   In this example, the participant highlights both her sadness and her happiness as she describes the difficult work of therapy. In another example, a different participant describes his mixed emotional experience about the events of his recent life:   This has been a difficult couple of weeks. My wife and I celebrated the good news of a healthy pregnancy report at nine weeks (the time when we lost our pregnancy last January). But I also feel the sadness of still looking for a job and for my wife and my pending loss of my wife's grandmother. It feels as if “what more can I take.” But, in reality I also feel reasonably confident and happy. Not that I don't feel down, but I also feel happy with my marriage.   In this excerpt, the participant notes the concurrent positive and negative emotions he has experienced over the past two weeks. He describes feeling both happy and sad at the same time in the context of his marriage.  This approach to collecting patients' perspectives has been touted as a robust vehicle for tapping the private ways in which individuals understand their experiences in both clinical and community samples [26] , [27] , [39] , [40] . It has been used in several prior investigations of patients' internal process over the course of psychotherapy [39] , [41] – [44] .     Procedure   Assessment schedule  Prior to the first session of treatment, participants completed the STIC, the BFI, and wrote a personal narrative. Then, in between every session of psychotherapy for the next twelve sessions participants again completed the STIC and wrote narratives providing their perspectives on treatment. After the twelfth assessment point, participants again completed the BFI to assess dispositional traits. Five participants concluded treatment prior to the twelfth assessment point, two concluded treatment at the twelfth assessment point, and the rest continued on in treatment past the twelfth assessment point. This variability was appropriate, given that the focus of the present study was on assessing the unfolding relationships between mixed-emotional experience and psychological well-being, not on assessing final treatment outcome. At all times, narratives were kept confidential from therapists, such that participants could feel free to express their genuine perspectives. In total, over 500 narratives were collected.    Blinding narratives  Following the completion of participation for the entire sample, participants' narratives underwent an extensive blinding procedure. They were assigned random study identification numbers and transcribed by individuals not involved in subsequent coding of the narratives. This procedure ensured that once narratives were coded by raters there was no way to identify which individual or which session a given narrative was drawn from.    Coding narratives  A team of two trained raters (undergraduate research assistants, trained by the first author, who were blind to the hypotheses of the study and unfamiliar with the coactivation model) coded the narratives for their emotional content. Previous theoretical and empirical work on mixed emotional experience has taken a broad approach to operationalizing the construct, including generic categories of “positive” and “negative” emotional experience. In contrast, in the present study we sought to empirically identify the specific blend of positive and negative emotions that are associated with improvements in psychological well-being. The narratives were coded for eight specific emotions (happiness, excitement, surprise, sadness, fear/anxiety, anger, shame, guilt). These emotions were selected based on the seminal work of Ekman [45] identifying universally expressed emotions (happiness, surprise, sadness, fear/anxiety, anger), and augmented with several additional emotions likely to be relevant in the therapeutic context (shame, guilt, excitement). Further, in previous work on personal narratives, McAdams and colleagues [46] assessed six of these specific emotions in evaluating the affective tone of personal narratives, and Coifman and colleagues [16] assessed three of these emotions in evaluating bereavement responses.  In the present study, McAdams and colleagues' [46] presence/absence coding system and method for calculating inter-rater reliability were employed. Raters were trained to rigorous standards of inter-rater reliability on a subset of the narratives (roughly 10% of the entire sample was coded by both raters), after which the remaining narratives were assessed independently by one rater. Periodic checks to prevent drift in the coding process were conducted. Inter-rater reliabilities were as follows: happiness: 0.86, surprise: 0.82, sadness: 0.89, fear/anxiety: 0.89, anger: 0.80, shame: 0.80, guilt: 0.82. Following standard narrative coding procedures, every narrative was coded for each theme sequentially, meaning that each of the 518 narratives was read eight separate times, resulting in 4,144 individual narrative codes.     Analytical approach  The primary analytical strategy applied fixed-effects hierarchical linear modeling (HLM) to assess the growth curves of variables over time [47] – [49] . An advantage of HLM is its ability to account for missing data, participants with differing numbers of assessment points, and uneven spacing in the data collection schedule, collectively referred to as “unbalanced data” [47] (p. 146). Because the present study assessed change in a naturalistic treatment setting, the dataset is characterized by such irregularities, and it was therefore vital to have an analytic strategy that could accommodate such “messy” data. In each model, both the final estimation of fixed effects of the individual parameters will be presented (with robust standard errors), as well as the random effects for the overall model. Also, in every model, the passage of time is counted in number of days from the first assessment point, thus tapping the actual amount of time elapsed between assessments.     Results   Preliminary analyses  Before testing the primary hypothesis of the present study – that mixed emotional experience would be associated with improvement in psychological well-being over time – it was first necessary to assess the trajectories of participants' psychological well-being itself, as well as the association between each of the eight specific emotions coded in participants' narratives and psychological well-being over time. Indeed, if participants' overall psychological well-being did not reliably change over time, or if no significant change in a given emotion was associated with clinical improvement, then the data would be unable to speak to the primary hypothesis.  Results of this first set of models are displayed in Table 3 . The first model (Model 1) was designed to assess whether participants' psychological well-being improved over time. In this model, the passage of time is entered at the first level as a predictor and psychological well-being is entered as the outcome. The results of this model indicate that, indeed, participants' psychological well-being did improve over the passage of time (aligning with the findings from decades of research indicating that psychotherapy is effective).  10.1371/journal.pone.0035633.t003 Table 3  Models of change in psychological well-being and specific emotions over time (final estimation of fixed effects, with robust standard errors).

In the next set of models (Models 2–9), the relationship between each specific emotion and psychological well-being was assessed, accounting for the passage of time. In these models, specific emotion was entered at the first level, along with the passage of time as a simultaneous predictor, and psychological well-being was entered as the outcome variable. There was no second level to these models, as we were investigating trends across all participants, not looking for differences between sub-sets of participants. Models 2–9 therefore describe the relationships between each specific emotion and overall psychological well-being, accounting for the passage of time. These models suggest that increases in happiness and decreases in sadness were significantly associated with improvement in psychological well-being over time. None of the other specific emotions were significantly associated with improvement in psychological well-being.   Operationalizing mixed emotions  Given that happiness and sadness were the only specific emotions to show a significant relationship with psychological well-being over time, the six other specific emotions were dropped from subsequent analysis and a composite variable, representing instances when happiness and sadness co-occurred, was created. The remaining analyses investigated the unfolding relationship between the co-occurrence of happiness and sadness and psychological well-being. Indeed, recent empirical work has demonstrated that these positive and negative emotions are not necessarily opposite ends of a single continuum [50] and that both happiness and sadness can be experienced at the same time [19] , [51] . In line with previous research that has focused on happiness and sadness specifically [18] , [19] , including Lazarus' proposal that these are emblematic positive and negative emotions [20] , the present study adopted an empirical approach to the operationalization of mixed emotional experience. The two examples of narratives drawn from the present sample included in the Method section above both illustrate narratives that featured concurrent happiness and sadness.     Primary analyses   Association between mixed emotions and psychological well-being  As described above, a composite variable capturing only those instances wherein participants' narratives were characterized by concurrent happiness and sadness was created. This allowed for the construction of a model testing the primary hypothesis of the present study: that concurrent happiness and sadness would be positively associated with psychological well-being over time. Model 10, as displayed in Table 3 , was constructed with the composite mixed emotions variable and the passage of time as concurrent predictors and psychological well-being as the outcome. This model indicates that the concurrent experience of happiness and sadness was significantly positively associated with improvements in psychological well-being, controlling for the impact of the passage of time.    Controlling for relevant personality traits  Having provided support for the primary hypothesis of this study, it was also possible to assess the relationship between concurrent happiness and sadness and psychological well-being over time, controlling for the impact of dispositional personality traits that might explain this relationship. Specifically, the traits of neuroticism and extroversion have shown strong associations with affective experience and well-being [37] , [38] . Before doing so, the overall change in each personality trait was assessed. Neuroticism was the only personality trait to show significant changes over the twelve assessment points ( t (46) = −3.00, p <.01, Cohen's d  = 0.88). While personality traits would not typically be expected to change significantly over the course of a roughly fourteen-week period (the mean period of participation in the present study) previous research has consistently found that certain trait scores, especially neuroticism, might be elevated during episodes of psychopathology [52] and some studies have observed shifts in traits over the course of psychotherapy independent of changes in psychopathology [53] , [54] .  Thus, the relationship between concurrent experience of happiness and sadness and psychological well-being was assessed controlling for the passage of time and for changes in trait neuroticism. This model, Model 11 in Table 3 , replicated Model 10, but added a second level to the model, allowing it to examine whether there were significant differences in the relationship between mixed emotional experience and psychological well-being over time across participants with different levels of change in their trait neuroticism. Model 11 indicates that the association between mixed emotional experience and psychological well-being remained significant when additionally controlling for the passage of time as well as changes in trait neuroticism (indeed, the significant change in neuroticism itself was no longer significantly associated with changes in psychological well-being when the passage of time was included in the equation). In addition, a model testing the relationship between mixed emotional experience and psychological well-being also remained significant when Time 1 neuroticism was entered at a second level. In other words, there were no significant differences in the association between the concurrent experience of happiness and sadness and psychological well-being across participants with different levels of neuroticism before treatment. This pair of findings indicates that the association between experiencing happiness and sadness concurrently and improvements in psychological well-being is quite robust and cannot simply be reduced to the impact of long-standing dispositional personality traits associated with emotion and well-being.    The prospective link between mixed emotions and psychological well-being  Having established the association between one type of mixed emotional experience and improvements in psychological well-being it was also possible to investigate whether changes in mixed emotional experiences precede improvements in psychological well-being. Given the naturalistic setting of the present study it was not possible to determine causality; additional experimental manipulations would be required for that. However, association and temporal precedence are preconditions for causality. Having established a significant association between mixed emotional experience and psychological well-being we sought to examine these variables' temporal relationship. If the temporal precedence of changes in mixed emotional experience were observed, it would underscore the power of mixed emotional experience in influencing psychological well-being. Following recommendations by Singer and Willett [47] , a model (displayed in Table 4 ) was constructed in which improvements in psychological well-being were lagged one assessment point and included in the model at level 1, such that the temporal precedence of changes in mixed emotional experience could be investigated. It has been suggested that this analytic strategy of using time-lagged HLM may offer insight into the causal relationship between variables [55] . This model (Model 12) indicated that there was a significant relationship between the concurrent experience of happiness and sadness and subsequent improvements in psychological well-being one assessment point later. A test of this model, controlling for changes in trait neuroticism remained significant (Model 13). Likewise, a multi-level test of this model, with neuroticism entered as a level-2 variable produced analogous results. These findings indicate that changes in mixed emotional experience were significantly positively associated with subsequent improvements in psychological well-being, controlling for the impact of dispositional traits. It is worth noting that a converse model (Model 14), in which changes in psychological well-being were assessed relative to changes in mixed emotional experience at a lag of one assessment point, was not significant.  10.1371/journal.pone.0035633.t004 Table 4  Additional models (final estimation of fixed effects, with robust standard errors).

Controlling for the independent effects of happiness and sadness  This relationship between concurrent happiness and sadness and subsequent improvements in psychological well-being remained significant when controlling for changes in happiness and sadness independently by entering them as concurrent predictors at level 1 of the model ( Table 4 , Model 15). However, this was not the case when predicting current psychological well-being status from concurrent happiness and sadness while controlling for happiness and sadness independently ( Table 4 , Model 16). In other words, the concurrent experience of happiness and sadness prospectively preceded increases in psychological well-being above and beyond the influence of happiness and sadness independently, but this effect was non-significant when examined at the same moment in time. The pattern of findings indicates that increases in the concurrent experience of happiness and sadness temporally precede increases in psychological well-being (and not vice versa). In addition, it suggests that the true benefit from concurrent happiness and sadness may not be instantaneous, but prospective, in line with theoretical predictions from the co-activation model of health [4] .      Discussion  The present study provides empirical evidence that mixed emotional experience is associated with and has a prospective positive relationship with psychological well-being in the context of psychotherapy. The results indicate that participants who experienced a concurrent mixture of happiness and sadness during the course of treatment enjoyed subsequent improvements in their psychological well-being. This finding remained significant when controlling for the impact of the passage of time as well as that of dispositional personality traits associated with affect. In addition, the results suggest that the significant association between the experience of concurrent happiness and sadness is uniquely related to psychological well-being at the following assessment point, but not concurrently, when controlling for the independent impacts of happiness and sadness themselves. In other words, mixed emotional experience was seen to have a prospective influence on psychological well-being, but its concurrent association with psychological well-being was explained by the independent effects of happiness and sadness. This suggests that mixed emotional experience may have a distinct prospective potency; its association with psychological well-being unfolds over time. Thus, while the concurrent experience of happiness and sadness in the face of adversity might not provide immediate benefit, it may signal enhancements in psychological well-being in the near future.  In the present study we employed a bottom-up, empirical approach to operationalizing mixed emotions. As a result, the current research also demonstrates specificity with respect to the relationship between mixed emotional experience and improvements in psychological well-being. Only the blend of happiness and sadness preceded enhanced psychological well-being, indicating that any mix of positive and negative emotions may not have the potency of concurrent happiness and sadness. Further, it is also worth noting that despite the voluminous literature on psychotherapeutic change [29] , [31] , [56] and the role of affect in psychotherapy [6] , [56] , a novel aspect of the present study is that it specifically examines the concurrent experience of positive and negative emotions as it relates to improvements in psychological well-being over the course of psychotherapy.  Importantly, the research paradigm that we employed never directly asked participants to report their emotional experiences; rather we were able to unobtrusively assess the emotions that participants were feeling by using a narrative coding procedure. This approach was grounded in work on patients' perspectives of treatment [26] , [27] , [41] , where it has been fruitfully used for accessing individuals' private understanding of their experiences. In the context of the present study, such an approach allowed us to assess emotional experience in an especially ecologically valid fashion; participants were not aware that we would specifically be assessing their emotional experience and thus their narratives were not written in a way that might have purposely highlighted emotional content.   Limitations  Our research was conducted in a naturalistic setting (an outpatient clinic), which speaks to the ecological validity of the study. However, the extent to which our findings can be generalized to non-therapy patients is currently unknown. Presumably, because our participants were demographically similar to the general treatment-seeking population [32] we can only offer speculation that the link between concurrent happiness and sadness and improvements in psychological well-being may be a generalizable phenomenon, at least within clinical populations, but future research will need to be conducted to fully determine this.  Along similar lines, it is possible that psychotherapy is a context in which negative emotions are particularly important. Certainly several approaches to psychotherapy, such as exposure-based treatments [28] , specifically embrace negative emotional experience as vital to treatment outcome. In addition, newer positive psychotherapy approaches have explicitly focused on the different roles of negative and positive affect in psychotherapeutic outcome [22] , but whether the present findings might apply in that domain is unknown. Thus, whether we would observe the effects that we found in specific treatment approaches or in non-therapeutic settings is still unknown. The inclusion of a non-clinical control group in our study would have facilitated such an extrapolation of the results. Future research should test whether mixed emotional experience benefits psychological well-being in non-clinical settings.  Using a similar approach to the one taken in several previous studies [16] , [46] , we examined the presence of several specific emotions in the course of participants' therapeutic process. Having found that happiness and sadness were the sole emotions that were linked to psychological well-being in our sample, we explored the relationship between the concurrent experience of these two emotions and improvement in psychological well-being. It is possible, of course, that other measures that tap into different aspects of emotional experience, such as arousal (e.g., the PANAS [57] ) could yield different results, or at the very least, a more nuanced portrait of the relationship between mixed emotions and psychological well-being.  Further, the timeline of our study does not allow us to assess the long-term effects of mixed emotions on psychological well-being, or their relationship with treatment outcome. It is possible that the mixed emotions that our research participants experienced marked the beginning of a path of improvement, a marker of impending clinical outcomes as opposed to a mechanism, or it could be the case that mixed emotions are indicative of a more sustained high level of psychological well-being. Our investigation focused on identifying whether there was a prospective relationship between concurrent happiness and sadness and psychological well-being and used psychotherapy as the context for doing so. However, since the study only covered the initial phase of treatment it is possible that the longer-term relationship between mixed emotional experience and psychological well-being might look different.  It is also possible that the study design itself, with such frequent assessments, may have influenced the outcomes of the study. Although it is a problem common to longitudinal studies that include fine-grained assessment of variables over time, practice effects of repeated completion of the STIC may have biased subsequent responding. In addition, it is possible that the writing of the narratives may itself have acted as an intervention, enhancing psychological well-being. The ameliorative effects of written disclosure of difficult experiences are well-documented [8] , [9] . The addition of a control group completing a writing exercise on non-emotional content would have enabled the present study to assess the impact of the narrative task itself.  The exact mechanism through which the concurrent experience of happiness and sadness is associated with psychological well-being is still unknown. Based on Larsen and colleagues' [4] co-activation model, we speculate that participants who experience concurrent happiness and sadness through the course of therapy may be, in essence, making meaning of negative events in their lives. That is, by experiencing happiness and sadness concurrently, individuals may theoretically be able to confront and process the events that ultimately led to sadness or negativity [10] . Although narrative construction has been previously been used as a vehicle to tap meaning-making [39] – [41] , [58] , future work should more directly measure whether meaning-making is a mediating link between mixed emotions and well-being.  Finally, the results of the current study essentially provide evidence for two of the three criteria necessary for causality [59] : co-variation and temporal precedence. Further research, however, should attempt to tackle the third criterion – the clean, confound-free manipulation of the independent variable – to rule out alternative explanations for cause-effect linkages. For example, a group of psychotherapy patients could be experimentally encouraged to approach stressors with a blend of happiness and sadness while others do not engage in this manipulation. Future research could also seek to address this limitation by extending our approach beyond the psychotherapeutic context to experimentally manipulate the concurrent experience of happiness and sadness and assess its impact on well-being in other settings.    Implications for Future Research and Clinical Practice  This study has important implications for research on mixed emotional experience. In specifying a particular blend of emotions – concurrent happiness and sadness – that are associated with improved psychological well-being, the results of this study indicate that future research ought to focus on these specific emotions, or adopt an equally empirical approach to defining mixed emotional experience. Furthermore, the present study also suggests that future research on mixed emotional experience and well-being would benefit from study designs that allow for the fine-grained assessment of the dynamic course of this relationship over time.  Given the context in which it was conducted, this study also has important implications for both the study and practice of psychotherapy. Our findings indicate that fostering mixed emotional experience in psychotherapy clients may prospectively enhance improvements in their psychological well-being. This finding aligns with theory and results from the study of psychotherapy more generally [6] , as well as some more recent promising work from the study of positive psychotherapy in particular [21] – [23] . Like these studies, the current research indicates that treatment should not focus strictly on the elimination of negative emotional experience, as negative emotions may be fundamental in the process of clinical improvement. Embracing the benefits of mixed emotional experience could be easily folded into most theoretical approaches to conducting psychotherapy.    Conclusion  Taken together, the results of the present study suggest that experiencing happiness and sadness concurrently is associated with psychological well-being and that doing so temporally precedes improvements in psychological well-being among psychotherapy patients. Future work will hopefully clarify the generalizability of these findings, as well as the specific mechanisms by which mixed emotions can benefit psychological well-being. Nonetheless, the current work indicates that the co-activation of these specific positive and negative emotions – happiness and sadness – may provide the brightest path in the course of navigating life's challenges.

Emotional Intelligence (EI) can be defined as the capacity to recognize emotions in oneself and others, understand how they originate, develop, and change during emotional experience, and use this understanding to enhance thinking and behavior. Two conceptually different approaches have been developed to study EI: the trait and the ability approach [1] . The first conceives EI as a dispositional tendency, such as a personality trait, and measures the construct with self-report questionnaires; the second conceptualizes EI as an ability based on the processing of emotion information and assesses it with performance tests. This article concerns the latter approach of EI; more specifically, it presents a contribution regarding the most well-known and employed test to measure EI as an ability: The Mayer Salovey Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test or MSCEIT [2] .  The ability EI approach was introduced in its original formulation by Salovey and Mayer [3] . It received encouraging feedback throughout the years [4] and was considered worth pursuing even by skeptics of the EI concept (e.g. [5] ). Although the ability approach shows promise, several issues still remain unsettled. Research has yet to demonstrate the extent to which ability EI is distinct from other existing constructs - such as personality and general intelligence - and how it accounts for emotionally intelligent performance. For instance, the personality trait of agreeableness predicted a substantial amount of variance in EI scales (e.g. [6] , [7] ).  Furthermore, several studies failed to find an association between ability EI scales and emotion information processing, showing that current measures of EI may be tapping into just one aspect of intelligence, namely crystallized intelligence [8] , [9] , [10] .  A fundamental issue that has not received adequate attention from EI scholars refers to better understanding what aspect of EI current ability tests measure and with what level of accuracy. In fact, there is scarcity of tests measuring EI as a form of intelligence. The Mayer Salovey Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test (MSCEIT) is among the very few available and the most well-known and accepted measure of EI as an ability. Thus, conclusions about EI as a meaningful construct and of its utility in predicting various outcomes mostly rely on the properties of this test. Hence, discerning whether a test of EI can be trusted, and to what extent, is of primary importance for advancing research in this domain.  We aimed to provide a contribution on the quality of ability EI tests by analyzing the MSCEIT from a perspective that is relatively new to the domain of EI: the Item Response Theory (IRT). We opted for such an approach because it allows for investigating the properties of this test at the item level and because it provides a different evaluation of the test than classical test theory (CTT). For instance, CTT assumes that the measurement precision of a test remains constant along the underlying latent trait. With IRT we aimed to test whether this assumption holds true for the MSCEIT along the different trait levels so as to understand whether this test is a good tool for discriminating individuals along the ability EI trait, especially those placed at the higher end of the distribution.   Measuring EI as an Ability  Ability EI tests differ greatly from self-report measures of EI because they are based on the analysis of how individuals perform at their best in certain conditions (maximal performance) instead of assessing how individuals perform on a daily basis (typical performance). Furthermore, in ability EI tests, correctness of responses is not evaluated by the subject him/herself, as it is the case for personality questionnaires, but it is determined on the basis of an external criterion of correctness. The issue of how to establish a correct answer in the domain of emotional intelligence has been (and still remains) the most difficult conundrum to address. Among the most problematic aspect there is how to determine the one best way of using/feeling emotions across individuals, given that individuals may differ with respect to how they feel and manage emotions effectively. Furthermore, correctness of emotional reactions may depend on the frame of reference for judging a response as correct. For example, suppressing anger when receiving a negative feedback from the supervisor may be an effective way to manage emotions if the goal of the person is to preserve a good relationship with the boss. However, it may not be considered as an effective reaction if the criterion is to maintain self-esteem and reduce frustration.  How did the authors of the EI test address the issue of scoring the test with respect to an allegedly correct response? Appealing to the idea that emotions are biologically determined (and therefore also shared by all human beings) Mayer, Caruso, and Salovey [11] proposed to score a correct answer according to the response chosen by the majority of people. For example, if a person chooses an answer that was also chosen by 75% of the respondents, then that person obtains a score of.75. The problem residing in the logic of this scoring system appears particularly evident when answers are easy to endorse. In fact, in the case of an easy to endorse answer, most people will get the highest score for a question that is, in fact, easy (i.e. most people identify the correct answer). Furthermore, as noted by MacCann and colleagues [12] , if the test is internally consistent and reliable, then the majority of people who score high on an item tend to score high also on other items, especially when items are on average rather easy. The result is that the distribution of the test scores tends to be skewed toward the high end of the distribution, with average and above average EI individuals constituting the peak of the distribution.  Notably, the authors of the MSCEIT also proposed a second scoring system: the expert-based scoring. In this case the correct answer is identified according to the responses provided by the majority of a pool of emotion experts. Mayer, Caruso, and Salovey [11] encouraged using the consensus-based instead of the expert-based scoring because considered more reliable. In any case, the expert scoring does not seem to provide an alternative to the skewedness issue in that, as indicated by the test authors, correlation between the two scoring systems are as high as.99, showing that the experts’ opinion does not diverge much from that of the majority of people, as also recognized by the authors themselves [13] .  The concerns previously expressed on the scoring systems of the MSCEIT motivated the current analysis. We decided to investigate the MSCEIT at the item level to check how appropriate they are to measure EI and to discriminate individuals along the EI trait. In particular, we employed latent trait models and analyzed individuals’ responses to items in relation to the properties of the items as well as the position of the individual along the latent trait. Importantly, with Item Response Theory we were able to understand whether the precision of the MSCEIT changed along the latent trait, challenging the assumption of Classical Test Theory that this precision remains constant.   The MSCEIT  The Mayer Salovey Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test was the first test introduced to measure EI as an ability. Since its very first appearance in 2000 (the test at that time was called Multifactor Emotional Intelligence Scale or MEIS) the MSCEIT has undergone several revisions. The current structure of the test reflects the four-branch model of EI of Mayer and Salovey [14] according to which EI is arranged in a hierarchical structure with one global underlying factor, EI, and 4 abilities or branches: Perceiving Emotions, Using Emotions to Facilitate Thinking, Understanding Emotions, and Managing Emotions. In addition to the theoretical model, the test also includes an intermediate level in which the first two branches are merged into an Experiential Area score and the second two branches into a Strategic Area score. Notably, the authors have recommended using the global score of the MSCEIT in view of the fact that the test measures “one unique source of variation” ( [15] p.508).  In addition, each branch is measured through two subscales: Perceiving Emotions includes identifying emotions conveyed through facial expressions and abstract pictures; Using Emotions includes items referring to evaluating how certain moods may facilitate thinking processes and the comparison of emotions to sensations, such as color, light, and temperature; Understanding Emotions includes two subscales that refer to blending emotions and acknowledging how emotions may change and develop; Managing Emotions includes two subscales that refer to rating which emotional strategy would be most appropriate to manage emotions for oneself and with respect to using emotions in interpersonal relationships. All the 141 items included in the test are answered through a Likert-type scale from 1 (not at all present/not at all effective) to 5 (very much present/effective). The MSCEIT was presented as a valid measure of EI [16] , [17] , [18] although some doubts about its validity were raised in the past (e.g. [19] ) and have become more compelling in recent years (e.g. [6] , [9] , [20] , [21] ).   An IRT Approach to the MSCEIT  Item Response Theory denotes a set of mathematical models in which the probability of endorsing a certain response to an item is modeled as a function of the characteristics of the item as well as the respondent’s position along the latent trait. Whereas Classical Test Theory (CTT) has the whole test as the unit of analysis, IRT models provide a way of measuring the quality of a test by analyzing single items, looking into how appropriate they are for discriminating respondents, and testing how well such items measure respondents’ underlying ability/trait. Another important advantage of IRT over CTT is that it may measure the precision of a scale without assuming that it remains constant along the underlying latent trait.  IRT applications to the domain of EI are rather scarce. Cooper and Petrides [22] employed IRT to assess the psychometric properties of the short form of the trait EI test (TEIQue-SF; [23] ). The questionnaire showed good precision in discriminating individuals along the trait and high information values for most items. Regarding ability EI, Maul [24] conducted an item analysis of the MSCEIT to investigate the hypothesized structure of the test. He found no strong evidence for preferring a unidimensional model over a four-dimensional model of EI when controlling for facet-related variance. Importantly, no research to date has employed IRT to understand whether the MSCEIT can be trusted as an ability test that discriminates among individuals along the EI trait.  To conduct the analysis we chose unidimensional models of the Rasch family, which assume that items have an equal relationship with the underlying trait and estimate for all items a common discrimination parameter. The simplest Rasch model is the one-parameter logistic (1PL) model in which the probability P of endorsing a correct answer is calculated as a function of the latent trait theta (θ) and the characteristic of the item i, such that for each person j: Pij (θj, bi). More specifically, in this model the b parameter denotes the item difficulty, which corresponds to the point on the latent trait in which the person has 50% chance of responding correctly to the question. We preferred Rasch models because of their parsimony: they are relatively simple models and appeared to fit the data rather well. Furthermore, we used a partial credit Rasch model because the MSCEIT has multiple answers that are scored along a continuum from the most to the least correct answer.  Figure 1 depicts item responses through three probability curves: the red curve corresponds to the probability of choosing the wrong response, coded as 0; the green curve corresponds to the probability of choosing a partially correct answer, coded as 1; the blue curve corresponds to the probability of choosing the most correct answer, coded as 2. When the ability of the subject is low, then the most likely answer is a wrong answer (on the left side of the graph, the red curve prevails). When the ability of the subject is average, then it is more likely that the person will chose a partially correct answer (the central part of the graph is mostly taken by the green line). When the ability of the subject is high, then it is very likely that the person will provide the most correct answer (the right part of the graph is mostly occupied by the blue line).  10.1371/journal.pone.0098827.g001 Figure 1  Example of Category Response Curve for the three scoring options employed in the current analysis.   To explore whether items are equally good at distinguishing individuals on the latent trait, we calculated the item information function (IIF), which indicates the amount of information yielded by each item. This feature of IRT is particularly helpful to determine the precision of measurement of individuals at different levels of the underlying trait. For most models, the amount of information provided by each item is maximized when the difficulty of the item approaches the latent trait of the person. Because item information calculated according to the Rasch model tends to be the same for all items given the constraint of equal discrimination, to calculate IIF we decided to employ a more complex model. We therefore conducted IFF analyses with a 2 PL model in which we allowed item discrimination to vary from item to item.  In addition to estimating the item parameters, we also estimated respondents’ ability using a Bayesian procedure. For each subject we estimated the theta distribution apriori. Then we summarized this distribution a posteriori through its mean. Bock and Mislevy [25] proposed a way to calculate the aposteriori expectation of theta based on a apriori distribution obtained from the data. They called the estimation resulting from this procedure estimation EAP (expected a posteriori). For most of the analyses we employed the software ConQuest [26] that estimates the latent trait using marginal maximum likelihood estimation (MMLE) in which item parameters are treated as fixed effects and ability parameters as random effects. Model fit was tested with residual-based methods developed by Wu [27] . To calculate additional functions, such as the Item Information Function, we also employed the package ltm [28] .   Method   Participants and Procedure  The sample consisted of 729 participants from the French speaking part of Belgium; 408 were women and 321 men. The mean age was 33.29 years (SD = 12.55). The sample included 152 undergraduate students who were enrolled in psychological courses. The other participants consisted of student's acquaintances. They were recruited by asking students to have the MSCEIT completed by friends and relatives in the framework of a course assignment.   Ethics Statement  Participation in the study was voluntary and participants could quit the study at any time they wished. The IRB approval was not required at the time the study was conducted.   Measure  We employed the French version of the Mayer, Salovey, and Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test (MSCEIT) version 2.0, which was filled out online. The test assesses EI with 141 items that are organized in 4 characteristics or ‘Branches’: Perceiving Emotions, which is measured through 2 subscales (sections A and E) referring to identifying emotions conveyed through facial expressions and pictures; Using Emotions, which includes 2 subscales (sections B and F) that refer to how emotions may be employed in different situations and how they may be associated with sensations, such as hot/cold; Understanding Emotions, which includes 2 subscales (sections C and G) referring to understanding the results of combinations of emotions and knowing how emotions may change and develop; Managing Emotions, which includes 2 subscales (section D and H) referred to rating which emotional strategy would be most effective for regulating the self and other people’s emotions. For each item participants indicated the level of effectiveness of a list of options, ranging from 1 = very ineffective to 5 = very effective, or the presence of a certain emotion, ranging from 1 = not at all present to 5 = present to a great extent. Correct answers were scored according to agreement with expert opinion. The test internal consistency reliability (split-half), as indicated in the manual, is r = .93 [29] .   Results   Descriptive Statistics  We conducted a first analysis on the distribution of responses for each item. The Shapiro-Wilk test showed that all the 141 items of the MSCEIT have a significantly skewed distribution. Interestingly, for the two sections of Branch 1 Perceiving Emotions, the most common answer was 1, which corresponds to absence of any emotion (the Likert scale goes from 1 = not at all present to 5 = present to a great extent). More specifically, response 1 was the most common answer for 15 out of 20 items of section A, and for 28 out of 30 items for section E. This implies that for this branch of the test (Perceiving Emotions) individuals obtain the highest score for, ironically, detecting the presence of ‘no emotions’.  Taking the raw score of each item, we calculated the correlation between the scoring of experts (expert scoring) and that based on the majority of respondents (consensus scoring). For 12 out of 141 items the correlation was either negative or close to 0, showing that experts and common people chose different correct answers on those few items. For 97/141 items the correlation was higher than .90. If taken at the level of the sub-dimensions and branches, correlations between the two scoring systems ranged between .94 and .99. These results show that the two systems provide very similar results and that the issue of the skewedness of responses is common to both scoring systems.   IRT Analysis  We recoded answers chosen by the majority of experts as ‘2’, answers that were close to the one chosen by the majority of experts as ‘1’, and all other answers as ‘0’. For example, if 4 was the answer chosen by the majority of people, then the score of 4 was recoded as ‘2’, the score of 5 and 3 were recoded as ‘1’, and the score of 1 and 2 were recoded as ‘0’. We employed this coding system to reduce the scoring options from 5 to 3 while maintaining the level of complexity of a partial credit approach.  We calculated scores on the 8 MSCEIT’s sub-dimensions based on the recoded answers (theta scores); then we calculated McDonald’s omega [30] to estimate the general factor saturation of the test and to check for the unidimensionality requirement of IRT. McDonald’s omega describes the ratio of the variance due to a common factor to the total variance. Results shows that a general factor explains 55% of the variance, and that introducing 3 intermediate factors to the model adds up 23% of variance. Although the latter model is better, the former still appears to fit the data rather well (see Figure 2 ).  10.1371/journal.pone.0098827.g002 Figure 2  Factorial structure of the MSCEIT’s sub dimensions and results of McDonald’s omega.   Parameter-level fit statistics, in particular the infit and outfit mean squares, were investigated. These indexes provide information regarding the extent to which the data fit the model. Values are expected to be close to 1; values lower than 1 indicate model redundancy, whereas values higher than 1 indicate that the model is under predicted. Fit indexes did not show any particular misfit for most items, with the exception of 12 items with unsatisfactory parameters, mainly in the two sections of Branch 1, Perceiving Emotions (see Table 1 for the list of problematic items; results of all items are available upon request). Overall results suggest that our model predicts data quite well.  10.1371/journal.pone.0098827.t001 Table 1  Infit and outfit statistics of the items that showed unsatisfactory parameters (e.g., values <3/4 and >4/3).

As an example, we report scores of the 2 sections of Branch 3 Understanding Emotions (results for all the MSCEIT sections showed the same pattern of Branch 3 and are available upon request). In the figure, the point marked as 1 corresponds to the point in which the probability of responding 0 is equal to the probability of responding 1. The point marked as 2 corresponds to the point in which the probability of responding 1 is equal to the probability of responding 2. When the point marked as 1 is left of point marked as 2, then it means that the most likely answer is the intermediate answer (or answer coded as 1). In contrast, when the point marked as 2 is left of point 1, then it means that the intermediate answer is very unlikely to occur, and that the item functions as if it were dichotomous. Most items show the latter pattern.  10.1371/journal.pone.0098827.g003 Figure 3  The person’s score on the same metric of the item difficulty for the two sections (C and G) of Branch 3, Perceiving Emotions.   The person-item map  Figure 4 shows the location of the estimated level of the person (left side, represented by the symbol X) and the items’ difficulty (right side) on the same latent trait for the two sections of Branch 4, Managing Emotions (results for the other sections of the MSCEIT present a similar patter and are available upon request). Both higher ability individuals and more difficult items are located on the upper side, whereas low ability and low difficulty on the lower side of the vertical line. The most evident result of this comparison is that the distribution of the persons is shifted with respect to the distribution of the items. This may be interpreted as if items are not difficult enough to challenge high ability individuals. The same pattern emerged across the different sections of the MSCEIT and is more evident in the data represented in Figure 5 as box-and-whisker plot. Here the bold line inside the boxes indicates the median, and the upper and lower limit of each box respectively the upper and lower quartile. The graph also shows the maximum and minimum score and the location of outliers, indicated by the small points at the very end of the distribution.  10.1371/journal.pone.0098827.g004 Figure 4  Location of the persons and the items on the same latent trait for the two sections of Branch 4-Managing Emotions: section D (left) and section H (right).  Each ‘X’ represents 4.7 cases.  10.1371/journal.pone.0098827.g005 Figure 5  Comparison of how items and individuals are positioned on the same latent trait in the eight sections of the MSCEIT.   The item information function  We calculated the amount of information provided by each item with the Item Information Function (IIF). The sum of the item response functions of a scale provides the test information function: Ij (θj) = Σi Iij (θj, bi). As previously discussed, to calculate this function we employed a more complex model in which we let the item discrimination vary from item to item. Results are shown in table 2 . The percentage indicated in the table is calculated within each subsection, therefore items of subsections with more items (ex. Section E) are on average less informative than items of a subsection with fewer items (ex. Section H). Ideally each subsection should be balanced in terms of how much each item contributes to the total information of that subsection. And yet, in Section H there are two items (H8 and H9) that provide less than 1% of information. Overall items appear very heterogeneous: 12.7% of the items provide less than 1% of information, whereas 14.2% provides more than 10% of information. The information provided by each item can be summed up and plotted to describe each branch’s information function ( Figure 6 ). From the graphs it is clear that the MSCEIT provides the most information for levels of the latent trait that are lower than 1 SD below the mean.  10.1371/journal.pone.0098827.g006 Figure 6  The Information Curve for each MSCEIT branches.  10.1371/journal.pone.0098827.t002 Table 2  Amount of information provided by each item as calculated with the Item Information Function.

Results of the IRT analysis revealed that the test items are rather heterogeneous in the amount of information provided, and that the four branches seem to be better suited to discriminate individuals at the low end of the EI trait. More specifically, whereas individuals at the low levels of the trait of EI provided different answers depending on the level of the trait, individuals at the mean and high level of the trait provided the same answers to items regardless of whether they were higher or lower on EI.   How to Use The MSCEIT In EI Research  The fact that this test does not seem to have strong measurement precision for distinguishing average from high EI individuals poses some limitations regarding how it should be employed for practice and research. Regarding its use for research, scholars employing this test should take into consideration the fact that the MSCEIT may not provide reliable results when employed with individuals that are supposed to cover the whole range of EI scores. In fact, in such cases the test would fail to detect differences among individuals that score average and above average, say on perceiving emotions, using emotions, understanding emotions, and managing emotions, providing similar scores for individuals that in fact are not on the same level of EI.  With respect to the use of the MSCEIT in applied settings, our analysis shows that this test would be appropriate for testing clinical subsamples that are expected to be below average on EI, but not for testing the normal population. MSCEIT users that employ the test for recruitment and personnel assessment should consider that this test may be effective to detect individuals with low EI, but it may not accurately discriminate average from above average individuals.   How to Improve the Current Version of the MSCEIT  Our analysis revealed that certain aspects of the MSCEIT could definitely be improved in a revised version. The item information function (IIF) showed that about 13% of the items included in the test provide less than 1% of information. Of note, the MSCEIT manual on p. 63 states that 19 items present in the test are excluded from the test scoring. We asked MHS the list of these items: 8 correspond to items that provide less than 1% of information. Eleven items could still be removed because of the low information they convey. Given the length of the test, these items could be simply removed without impacting on the psychometric properties of the test.  Our analysis shows that several items function as dichotomous rather than as items with different nuances of response. In addition, because most individuals identified the most correct answer, the different degrees of correctness were seldom endorsed, showing that the test items are overall rather easy. Consequently, as a second recommendation we suggest to improve the current version of the test by either scoring responses as correct or wrong, or by introducing response options that would guarantee more endorsement by test takers so as to capture nuances among individuals that possess different levels of the latent trait.  A final recommendation regarding how to improve the test does not derive directly from the results of the IRT analysis, but stems from a more general consideration on the scoring system employed in the MSCEIT. Mayer, Salovey, and Caruso have always recommended the consensus-based scoring as the best option (e.g., [11] ) claiming that this scoring system is the most reliable. To solve the issue raised by Roberts et al. [31] regarding the lack of convergence between expert and consensus-based scoring of the previous version of the MSCEIT, the MEIS, it seems as if the authors reacted by modifying the test in a way that caused experts and consensus ratings to converge from the original .26 of the MEIS to.98 of the current version of the MSCEIT. Perhaps their attempt to make the two systems converge was done at the expense of the quality of the items.  Mayer et al. ( [13] p. 237) explained the high levels of convergence by saying that “Experts look for the correct answer by paying attention to the consensual information of the group.” However, as Maul also noticed [20] , what the majority of people say about emotions may simply reflect lay theories, which, although shared by most, can still be incorrect. The ability to spot a fake smile is a good example of this effect. Maul [20] shows that this task is challenging for all but a restricted group of emotion experts. In this case a “correct” answer should be modeled on the few that can spot fake emotions, not on the modal answer in the total sample. In fact, the emotional intelligent ‘prototype’ person should be among the very few that can spot fake emotions, rather than among the vast majority of people that get them wrong. Thus, from a conceptual point of view, it would make more sense to score individuals with respect to a group that by itself could be equated with high EI individual (namely emotion experts), as long as items reflect differences between normal individuals and those that are higher than the norm. We suggest that these problems in the MSCEIT may be ameliorated by choosing items that show a certain degree of divergence (perhaps something in the middle between .26 and .98) rather than selecting those for which experts and general people provided almost the same answers.  Before concluding we would like to acknowledge certain limitations of our study. An assumption of measurement models is that correlations among items should be due only to the common latent trait. In a recent study [24] it was suggested to model variance in item response according to the stimulus material, so as to account for shared variance that depends on the structure of the test rather than on the latent trait. The idea is that if one person judges a picture as expressing a great extent of joy, then as a consequence this person will judge the picture as expressing very little sadness. Thus, scores on the joy and sadness items would depend at least in part on the interpretation of the picture and not exclusively on the level of Emotion Perception of the person. Maul’s recommendation certainly provides valuable inputs for further analyses of the MSCEIT. At the same time, we would like to raise the possibility that people may independently perceive such emotions in the same stimulus, very much on the line of research supporting the idea that negative and positive emotions may coexist (e.g. [32] ). Moreover, the issue of item dependence would affect especially the Perceiving Emotions branch of the MSCEIT and not necessarily the whole test.  It is important to notice that the results we found, in particular those on the mismatch between difficulty of items and position of individuals with respect to the same latent trait, as well as the demonstration that the MSCEIT provides the most information for levels of the latent trait corresponding to minus 1 standard deviation, were consistently observed across the different sections of the test. Therefore our analyses can be considered comprehensive and overall informative for the overall MSCEIT.   Conclusions  Recently Maul claimed that “The central idea of measurement is to have a procedure sensitive to differences in the thing being measured, such that (…) different responses to different items are reflective of different levels of emotional intelligence” ( [20] p. 8). Our analysis has shown that the MSCEIT’s items may capture differences in individuals only when such individuals are positioned at the low end of the EI trait distribution. For the other individuals (medium and high in EI) variation in the scores does not reflect true variation in EI. Given that most of the evidence collected up to date on the topic of ability EI is based on the employment of this test, and that the debate on the legitimacy of the EI construct has often taken this test as its flagship, our results warrant close consideration. We believe that understanding what aspect of EI the MSCEIT measures and how it measures it is of primary importance for advancing research in this domain.  Mayer and Salovey should be commended for having introduced the theoretical bases of EI and for having brought the study of EI on the scientific ground. We believe the domain of EI could be enhanced by better discerning the good from the less good of current research so as to build future theorization on solid foundations. After all, EI is still in its early developmental stage and it is especially at this scientific age that learning from mistakes is vital. We hope to have provided a constructive approach to one of the important issues surrounding EI, namely the extent to which scholars may rely on the MSCEIT to measure EI, and that future research will benefit from our contribution to build on the next generation of measures of EI.

The Iowa Gambling Task (IGT) is widely used in investigations of decision making. A growing number of studies have linked performance on this task to personality differences, with the aim of explaining the large degree of variability in healthy individuals' performance of the task. However, this line of research has yielded inconsistent results. In the present study, we tested whether increasing the conflict between short-term and long-term gains in the IGT can clarify personality-related modulations of decision making. We assessed performance on the original IGT as a function of the personality traits typically involved in risky decision making (i.e., impulsivity, sensation seeking, sensitivity to reward and punishment). The impact of these same personality traits was also evaluated on a modified version of the task in which the difference in immediate reward magnitude between disadvantageous and advantageous decks was increased, while keeping the net gain fixed. The results showed that only in this latter IGT variant were highly impulsive individuals and high sensation seekers lured into making disadvantageous choices. The opposite seems to be the case for participants who were highly sensitive to punishment, although further data are needed to corroborate this finding. The present preliminary results suggest that the IGT variant used in this study could be more effective than the original task at identifying personality effects in decision making. Implications for dispositional and situational effects on decision making are discussed.    The authors have no support or funding to report.      info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0058946.g004   Introduction  A remarkable body of data on decision making has been collected using an apparently simple paradigm that requires the subject to select cards from decks that vary in both the probability and the extent of potential wins and losses – the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT, [1] ). Crucially, this task entails resolving a conflict situation since, in order to achieve advantageous outcomes in the long-term, participants must select disadvantageous options in the short-term. The IGT was developed primarily to investigate impaired decision making in patients with frontal lobe damage; it has nonetheless also been used in countless studies that have investigated non-clinical samples. In this respect, a growing number of studies have recently linked IGT performance to personality differences as they have attempted to explain the large degree of variability in the performance of healthy individuals. Preliminary findings have suggested that specific personality traits can impact IGT performance, although results are often conflicting. Many studies have investigated this task by considering individual differences in the subjects' susceptibility to incoming rewards and punishments [2] , coherent with IGT's reliance on reward/punishment schedules. Although some studies detected a negative impact of these personality traits on IGT performance, the findings are inconsistent [3] – [6] . Similarly incongruous results have been observed in studies that focus on the relationship between IGT performance and impulsivity – a trait that is typically involved when conflicting short-term and long-term incentives are embedded in the task. Despite findings in clinical samples that seem to consistently support a link between impulsivity and dysfunctional choice behavior, the data from non-clinical samples are far from conclusive. Some studies have shown impulsivity to have a significant detrimental effect on IGT performance [4] , [7] – [11] ; in other studies, however, no such relationship between impulsivity and IGT performance has emerged [5] , [12] , [13] . Inconsistent effects have also been reported for Zuckerman's Sensation Seeking Scale (SSS; [14] ), which assesses how prone an individual is to exhibiting risky behaviors and making risky choices. Findings on this trait range from negative associations between IGT performance and specific facets of sensation seeking [8] , [15] , to null associations [3] , [13] , [16] , or even to unexpected, positive associations between gains and the total SSS [17] .  A full review of the research devoted to establishing associations between IGT performance and personality is beyond the scope of the present study. However, the brief literature survey presented above clearly suggests some measure of empirical inconsistency is present in the results thus far reported. Although the robustness of the IGT for investigating impaired decision making in clinical samples is well established, it could be argued that some specific features of the original IGT are less than ideal for detecting personality effects on healthy individuals' decision-making processes. In the present research, we hypothesize that a change in the original IGT reinforcement schedule aimed at increasing the degree of conflict between short-term and long-term gains could result in personality traits exerting more reliable effects on task performance. Therefore, we compared performance on the original IGT with performance on a modified version of the task introduced by Van den Bos and colleagues [18] . In this IGT variant (IGT-v), the difference in immediate reward magnitude between disadvantageous and advantageous decks was larger than in the original IGT. More specifically, the ratio of immediate rewards between disadvantageous and advantageous decks in the original IGT was 2∶1 (disadvantageous decks allowed one to gain €100 per selection, advantageous decks €50 per selection), whereas the ratio in the IGT-v was 6∶1 (disadvantageous decks allowed one to gain €300 per selection, advantageous decks €50 per selection). To assess the influence of the conflict between short-term and long-term gains on decision making, the immediate losses realized in disadvantageous decks were also increased to maintain a long-term net gain in those decks that would be identical to that of the original IGT.  Preliminary results, achieved in small, non-clinical samples, showed that this task variant severely impaired performance [18] . However, the effects of personality on this task have not yet been considered, despite the fact that the difficulties experienced when the conflict between short- and long-term gains increases effectively mimicked real-life situations in which personality has been shown to play a critical role in shaping decisions (e.g., health-risk circumstances, gambling contexts, etc.). To the best of our knowledge, the present study is the first to test the effects of sensitivity to rewards and punishments, impulsivity and sensation seeking on both IGT and IGT-v performance. We anticipate that the simple increase in immediate rewards/losses in disadvantageous decks in the IGT-v can disclose the effects of personality on decision making more effectively than can the reinforcement schedule of the original IGT.  Specifically, whereas it was difficult to predict sizeable effects of personality on IGT performance given the inconsistent evidence reported in the extant literature, we anticipated poorer performance among participants with high reward sensitivity in the IGT-v, since they can plausibly be described as being more sensitive to the increased immediate rewards of the disadvantageous decks. We expected similar poor performance on the IGT-v by highly impulsive participants, both because they can be more attracted to the increased immediate rewards of disadvantageous decks and because their distinctive planning deficits may be emphasized by the reward schedule of this task version. High sensation seekers were also expected to perform less efficiently on the IGT-v because the manipulation of the reinforcement schedule was thought to be likely to enhance the arousal produced by disadvantageous decks. In contrast, we anticipated better performance on the IGT-v among participants who were more sensitive to punishments, since the increased immediate losses of disadvantageous decks can induce such individuals to disregard such decks in order to avoid the anxiety generated by the prospect of losses.    Methods   Ethics statement  All participants gave their written, informed consent to take part in the study, which was performed after receiving approval from the University of Bologna, Department of Psychology Ethics Committee and in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration.    Participants and Procedure  One hundred and seventy participants took part in the study. However, five participants were excluded due to problems related to questionnaire completion; therefore, the final sample included 165 volunteers (mean age: 26.47, sd ±7.14 years; 58.8% university undergraduate students, 41.2% workers). Participants were informed that they would be participating in a card game with fictitious payoffs and were randomly assigned to perform either the original (IGT) or the modified version (IGT-v) of the Iowa Gambling Task. They then completed a booklet that included several personality questionnaires (see below), which were pseudo-randomized across participants.    Measures   Tasks  Decision making was assessed using two computerized versions of the Iowa Gambling Task – the IGT and the IGT-v.  In the IGT [1] , participants were required to maximize their gains by choosing one card at a time from any of 4 decks, across 100 trials, starting from a specific amount of virtual money (€2,000). Participants were only aware that decks varied in their probability and magnitude of wins and losses, and that some decks, being less advantageous than others, would need to be avoided if they were to maximize their earnings. Two decks (i.e., decks C and D) were advantageous, leading the subject to immediately win and lose small amounts, with an eventual net gain (+ €250 per block of 10 cards); the remaining two decks (i.e., decks A and B) were disadvantageous, leading subjects to immediately win and lose large amounts, with an eventual net loss (− €250 per block of 10 cards). In accordance with the original IGT [1] , the frequency of gains and losses in advantageous and disadvantageous decks was balanced. Namely, five of every ten trials generated a loss in decks A and C, whereas one in ten trials generated a loss in decks B and D. Participants did not know the rewards and punishments associated with each deck at the outset, but were able to learn it because they received visual feedback immediately after each selection, and were informed on the amount of money won or lost.  In the IGT-v [18] the ratio of immediate rewards between disadvantageous and advantageous decks differed from that in the original IGT. Specifically, in the original IGT the ratio was 2∶1, whereas in the IGT-v the ratio was 6∶1 (see Introduction section). In order to keep the net gain fixed with respect to that of the original IGT, the magnitude of immediate losses in the disadvantageous decks of the IGT-v was increased accordingly.    Personality questionnaires  The Behavioral Inhibition System (BIS) and Behavioral Approach System (BAS) Questionnaires [19] , [20] were used to index sensitivity to punishments and rewards. These included 20 items, each rated on a 5-point scale and comprising four different subscales: (1) Sensitivity to Punishments (BIS-Anxiety), (2) positive responses to the occurrence/anticipation of rewards (BAS Reward Responsiveness), (3) persistence in the pursuit of reward (BAS Drive), (4) desire for novel rewards and a willingness to approach potentially rewarding situations (BAS Fun Seeking). Although a total BAS score, which sums the scores of the three BAS subscales, is often used, theoretical and psychometric evidence has suggested that it is best to consider these scales separately, as they refer to dissociable features of Reward Sensitivity [21] , [22] .  The Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS-11, [23] , [24] ) was used to assess impulsivity. It consists of 30 items, each rated on a 4-point scale. The BIS-11 total score is computed by summing the scores of the three subscales that measure related facets of impulsivity: (1) a tendency to act without forethought in the spur of the moment (Motor Impulsiveness), (2) an orientation to the present or a lack of planning for the future (Non-Planning), and (3) difficulty in maintaining attention or concentration (Attentional Impulsiveness).  The Sensation Seeking Scale, version V (SSS-V, [14] ), was used to measure individual preferences for arousing and stimulating activities and experiences. It consists of 40 pairs of antithetical items and assesses the subject's tendency to engage in both dangerous/adventurous activities and new mental and sensory experiences, the subject's interest in socially and sexually disinhibited activities, and the subject's aversion to routine and repetitive activities. Higher scores in the SSS-V indicate a higher degree of sensation seeking.     Data analysis  In both task versions, in order to check for the presence of learning effects, analyses of trials grouped in five blocks (each block consisting of 20 consecutive trials) were performed using the net score as a dependent variable. This was computed as the difference between advantageous and disadvantageous deck selections, with a positive net score indicating more advantageous selections. We first examined participants' performance independent of personality variables through an Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA), specifying the five Blocks of net score as a within-group factor, Gender and Task Version (IGT vs. IGT-v) as between-group factors, and Age as a covariate (being this significantly different between females and males, see Results section). We then considered performance as a function of personality by performing, for each of the six measured traits, an ANCOVA with the same factors as above and the additional factor Group , obtained by splitting the volunteers according to the median score of the trait. Type-1 error for the 6 ANCOVAs was controlled for by setting the significance threshold at the level of p  = 0.008 (i.e. p  = .05/6). The Greenhouse – Geisser correction was applied when necessary and significant effects were explored using Tukey HSD post-hoc tests for unequal samples. In addition, Pearson correlations between personality traits and total net score were computed for each version of the task. To gauge the unique contribution of each trait to behavioral decision making, hierarchical regression analyses were performed – separately for each task version – by regressing the total net score on the self-reported traits. Gender and age were entered into the equation first, as statistical controls.  In order to detect the presence of effects in the gain-loss frequency dimension (i.e., decks A and C: loss in 50% of the trials vs. decks B and D: loss in 10% of the trials), we analyzed the number of selections from each deck during the entire task performance. In this regard, particular attention was devoted to the preference, if any, for deck B – an effect known as “prominent deck B” [10] , [25] , an index of irrational decision making sometimes reported among healthy participants. We therefore first examined participants' performance independent of personality variables, through an ANCOVA, specifying the 4 Deck Selection as a within-group factor, Gender and Task Version as between-group factors, and Age as a covariate. We then considered performance as a function of personality by performing ANCOVAs analogous to those previously described for the analyses in the gain-loss magnitude dimension.     Results  Table 1 shows the descriptive statistics for the total sample and for males and females separately. T-tests revealed that females were slightly younger and had higher BIS-Anxiety scores than did males, whereas males had significantly higher SSS-V scores. No gender differences were detected in task performance for either IGT version. Participants assigned to the original IGT ( N  = 84) and to IGT-v ( N  = 81) were equivalent in terms of gender distribution, age, and personality traits (all p s >0.05).   10.1371/journal.pone.0058946.t001  Table 1   Descriptive statistics (mean ± SD) of personality measures and task performance.

Net score analyses  The ANCOVA focused on learning effects revealed Block to have a significant main effect ( F (4,640)  = 5.15, η 2  = 0.03, p  = 0.001: the first block showed a significantly lower mean net score compared with the net score of all other blocks: the second block showed a mean net score significantly lower compared with the net scores of the fourth and fifth blocks, ; and the third block showed a net score lower than that of the fifth block (m±se of the net score in the five blocks: −4.43±0.42; 0.14±0.52; 1.17±0.65; 3.06±0.69; 3.62±0.74; p<0.01, Tukey HSD post-hoc tests). The main effect of Task Version was also significant ( F ( 1,160)  = 11.67, η 2  = 0.07, p  = 0.001), with the IGT-v characterized by a significantly lower mean net score per block (i.e., total net score divided by five blocks) than that of the original IGT (m±se: −0.64±0.56 and 2.06±0.55, respectively). The two-way Block by Task Version interaction was not significant ( F (4,640)  = 1.63, η 2  = 0.01, ns), a result that suggests that participants learned the advantageous choice strategy in both versions, considering the Block main effect. The two-way Gender x Task Version interaction approached statistical significance ( F (1,160)  = 3.23, η 2  = 0.02, p  = 0.07): females performed comparably in both versions (Females, IGT net score  = 1.25±0.71; Females, IGT-v net score  = 0.02±0.73; ns), whereas males performed significantly better in the classic IGT than in the IGT-v (Males, IGT net score  = 2.84±0.87; Males, IGT-v net score  = −1.26±0.87; p <0.01). In addition, a complex, three-way interaction, Gender x Task Version x Block, was found to be significant ( F (4,640)  = 2.62, η 2  = 0.02, p  = 0.041, see Figure 1 ). Post-hoc comparisons showed gender differences in the fifth block to be a function of IGT version: females' performance was the same irrespective of task version (females' IGT net score in the fifth block  = 2.97±1.44; females' IGT-v net score in the fifth block  = 3.02. ±1.51), whereas a remarkable decline in performance was observed for males in IGT-v as compared to IGT (males' IGT net score in the fifth block  = 8.19±1.51; males' IGT-v net score in the fifth block  = 0.31±1.53; p <0.001).   10.1371/journal.pone.0058946.g001  Figure 1   Net scores in the five blocks as a function of IGT version and Gender.

ANCOVAs that included the effects of personality variables did not yield significant results for the BIS-BAS scales (all p s >0.05).  We did detect, however, a main effect of Impulsivity ( F (1,156)  = 9.89, η 2  = 0.06, p  = 0.002), as measured by the BIS-11, which was qualified by the significant Impulsivity x Task Version interaction ( F (1,156)  = 7.52, η 2  = 0.05, p  = 0.007, see Figure 2A ). Post-hoc tests showed that highly impulsive individuals were characterized by poorer performance than less impulsive individuals only in the IGT-v ( p  = 0.0003).   10.1371/journal.pone.0058946.g002  Figure 2   Net scores as a function of IGT version for Impulsivity and Sensation Seeking levels.

Vertical bars denote +/−0.95 confidence intervals, * p ≤0.05, ** p ≤0.01.     The Impulsivity x Block interaction was also significant ( F (4,624)  = 4.96, η 2  = 0.03, p  = 0.001), indicating that more impulsive participants recorded significantly lower net scores than did less impulsive participants only in the fourth ( p  = 0.009) and fifth blocks ( p  = 0.01). Further analyses were performed with the purpose of establishing the possible contribution of the three BIS-11 subscales to the effect found for total Impulsivity. Such analyses revealed that Attentional Impulsiveness did not show any significant effect (all p s >0.05). Motor Impulsiveness showed a significant interaction with Task Version ( F (1,156)  = 4.20, η 2  = 0.03, p  = 0.042), similar to that found for total Impulsivity. Non-Planning showed the same three significant effects identified for total Impulsivity, thus emerging as the principal source of total Impulsivity effects – i.e., Non-Planning main effect ( F (1,156)  = 16.60, η 2  = 0.10, p  = 0.0001); Non-Planning x Task Version ( F (1,156)  = 4.01, η 2  = 0.02, p  = 0.047); and Non-Planning x Block ( F (4,624)  = 3.07, η 2  = 0.02, p  = 0.02).  A noteworthy interaction between Sensation Seeking and Task Version was found ( F (1,156)  = 6.95, η 2  = 0.04, p  = 0.009; see Figure 2B ). Although it failed to achieve full statistical significance after our correction ( p  = 0.008), this finding was explicitly anticipated in our hypotheses, and thus was considered to be worth mention. Post-hoc tests revealed that high sensation seekers performed worse than low sensation seekers only in the IGT-v ( p  = 0.02).

Total net score in the original IGT was only negatively associated with the Non-planning facet of Impulsivity. In contrast, the total net score in the IGT-v showed significant negative correlations with several personality dimensions, including Sensation Seeking as well as Impulsivity total score and its three subscales, Motor Impulsivity, Non-Planning and Attentional Impulsivity. In line with these findings, we also found a negative correlation between IGT-v net score and BAS Fun Seeking.  Hierarchical multiple regression analyses, which aimed to test the net effects of the traits under investigation on behavioral decision making, further showed that IGT-v was more effective than IGT at revealing the influence of personality on decision making. For the original IGT, the overall regression model (corrected R 2  = 0.107; F (10,73)  = 1.99, p  = 0.047) showed that participants scoring lower in the Non-Planning facet of Impulsivity performed better ( β  = −0.32, t  = −2.30, p  = 0.02). As regards the IGT-v, the traits included in the model accounted for more than twice the variance of performance on the IGT-v than the same traits accounted for in the model of performance on the IGT (corrected R 2  = 0.236; F (10,70)  = 3.47, p  = 0.001). For the IGT-v, the Non-Planning ( β  = −0.28, t  = −2.48, p  = 0.01) and Attentional Impulsivity ( β  = −0.24, t  = −2.03, p  = .046) facets negatively impacted performance, whereas BIS-Anxiety positively impacted performance ( β  = 0.27, t  = 2.20, p  = 0.03).    Deck selection analyses  The ANCOVA that focused on deck selection throughout the task revealed a significant main effect of Deck Selection ( F (3,480)  = 6.34, η 2  = 0.04, p  = 0.002), which was more clearly qualified by the significant Deck Selection x Task Version interaction ( F (3,480)  = 4.87, η 2  = 0.03, p  = 0.007, see Figure 3 ).   10.1371/journal.pone.0058946.g003  Figure 3   Selection from each deck as a function of IGT version.  Mean number of cards chosen from each deck in the original (IGT) and modified (IGT-v) task versions. Vertical bars denote +/−0.95 confidence intervals, (*) p  = 0.055,* p ≤0.05, *** p ≤0.001.     Post-hoc tests revealed that, in the IGT, there were significantly more selections made from decks B and D than there were made from decks A and C (all p s <0.001). Participants generally preferred decks with high-frequency gains – B and D – compared with decks with low-frequency gains – A and C. Conversely, in the IGT-v, the “prominent deck B effect” [25] was present, as there were significantly more selections made from this deck as compared with all other decks, including deck D (all p s <0.05). In addition, by directly comparing the two task versions, a marginally significant effect ( p  = 0.055) was found for deck B in particular, with more selections from this deck in the IGT-v than in the IGT.  ANCOVAs that included the effects of personality variables showed significant results only for Impulsivity, which interacted with Deck Selection ( F (3,468)  = 5.80, η 2  = 0.04, p  = 0.003). Post-hoc tests revealed that highly impulsive participants made significantly more selections from deck B ( p  = 0.01) and significantly fewer selections from deck D ( p  = 0.04) compared with less impulsive participants. Although the Impulsivity x Task Version x Deck selection interaction can be considered only marginally significant ( F (3,468)  = 3.56, η 2  = 0.02, p  = 0.027, see Figure 4 ) after the p -level correction (significance threshold: p  = 0.008), it did help in qualifying the Impulsivity x Deck Selection interaction.   10.1371/journal.pone.0058946.g004  Figure 4   Selection from each deck as a function of IGT version for Impulsivity levels.

Vertical bars denote +/−0.95 confidence intervals, ** p ≤0.01.     Indeed, post-hoc tests in the three-way interaction showed that the differences between high and low impulsive individuals were present exclusively in the IGT-v ( p  = 0.002 for deck B; p  = 0.01 for deck D). In addition, whereas low impulsive participants did not show differences in deck selection as a function of Task Version, highly impulsive individuals made significantly more selections from deck B ( p  = 0.006) and significantly fewer selections from deck D ( p  = 0.04) in the IGT-v as compared with the classic IGT.     Discussion  The present study was devoted to exploring the impact of personality on decision making by using a variant of the IGT, the IGT-v [18] , in which the immediate rewarded value of disadvantageous decks was increased while the long-term net gain of these decks was kept intact. This manipulation of the reinforcement schedule was aimed at magnifying the conflict between short- and long-term gains, and preliminary results showed it severely negatively impacted healthy participants' performance [18] . To the best of our knowledge, the IGT-v has not yet been used to investigate personality differences that might affect decision making in particular; therefore we have specifically addressed this issue in the present study.  The significantly worsened performance of participants on the IGT-v as compared with their performance on the original IGT supports the notion that, independent of personality traits, the more alluring pay-off of its disadvantageous decks allows it to impair long-term, efficient decision making, as previously reported by Van den Bos and colleagues [18] . Likewise, the fact that we identified the “prominent deck B” effect [25] exclusively in the IGT-v suggests that it allows for easier identification of suboptimal decision making tendencies than the original IGT.  Males and females showed different performance along the gain-loss magnitude dimension. Previous studies had reported gender-based differences in IGT performance, with males outperforming females in this task [13] , [17] , [26] , [27] . Although such a pattern was not clear in the results of the present study, we did identify a different learning effect in task performance as a function of both task version and gender. Specifically, females performed comparably in the two task versions, whereas males performed significantly worse in the IGT-v than in the classic IGT (with much of the decline occurring in the fifth block), showing to be particularly sensitive to the increased conflict between short-term and long-term gains. Since the more frequently reported personality differences between genders involve the same traits that are considered likely to affect decision making in the present study (i.e., impulsivity, sensation seeking, anxiety), it is reasonable to link the gender differences in performing the task to personality differences. Although the present data are insufficient for drawing strong conclusions, they offer a hint for future studies into the relationship between gender and personality and how that relationship might affect decision-making behaviors.  Turning attention to the effects of personality differences, although further data are needed to corroborate the preliminary findings of the present study, our results suggest that the IGT-v could be a more sensitive tool than the classic IGT in disclosing the effects of specific traits on choice behavior. We reason that the classic IGT generates a conflict between short- and long-term gains that can be too weak to make individual differences in personality relevant to how choices are made. The only personality trait that appeared to negatively influence performance on the original IGT was Impulsivity – the Non-Planning facet, in particular. The fact that such a component affected performance on the IGT-v, as well, and that it did so to an even greater extent, highlights the fundamental role a lack of planning (or a present-orientation) plays in impairing emotional decision behavior. The detrimental effects of impulsivity on the classic IGT have been reported elsewhere [4] , [7] – [11] . Nevertheless, the small impact of impulsivity on the original task may be the reason why its damaging effects on IGT performance sometimes went undetected [5] , [12] , [13] . We found that low impulsive participants outperformed high impulsive participants in the last two blocks of trials, in particular. Neurophysiological evidence suggests that different brain systems are involved in tasks that require the individual to evaluate immediate and delayed rewards [28] . Specifically, the first stages of performance require an active reward system so that the subject can learn or identify the best long-term options, whereas the latter stages require an efficient cognitive self-control system to keep the allure of immediate rewards at bay. Consistent with this model, the high impulsive individuals' performance deterioration in the later IGT blocks suggests that they show a comparative deficit in their self-control systems' ability to maintain the choice of the best long-term options. Analyses of individual preferences for specific decks further supported the irrational decision making of high impulsive participants, who showed a “prominent deck B” effect in the IGT-v – that is, a preference for deck B selections [25] . In this regard, Takano and colleagues [10] found that implicitly impulsive participants – i.e., those whose impulsivity was assessed by a behavioral test – showed the same preference for deck B in a modified version of the IGT characterized by progressive changes in delayed punishments. Our results extend these findings and support the “prominent deck B” effect for self-rated impulsive individuals in another variant of the IGT.  The anticipated effect of sensation seeking was also confirmed, as this personality trait in fact exerted a negative influence in the IGT-v. This was probably due to the higher level of arousal associated with disadvantageous decks, which made them riskier and thus more attractive to high sensation seekers.  In contrast with our expectations, BAS facets appeared to exert little influence irrespective of IGT version, with the notable exception of Fun Seeking, which was found to negatively correlate with advantageous decision making in the IGT-v. Since this trait shares many features with both sensation seeking and impulsivity [21] , the result is in line with the effects described above. As regards the other BAS facets, one possible reason for the null findings might be that the IGT, as well as the IGT-v, is less than ideally suited to highlight BAS involvement in decision making, due to the fact that it combines rewards, losses and risky outcomes (i.e., disadvantageous options were characterized not only by the greatest gains but also by the greatest losses). One possibility is that individuals with high Reward Sensitivity might have noted this co-occurrence and might have selected cards in order to preserve the long-term gains, regardless of variations in the reinforcement schedule. Indeed, unlike the Impulsivity dimension, which can be typified by the Non-Planning component, the core meaning of Reward Sensitivity is not directly associated with impaired planning skills; rather, it includes components such as reward responsiveness, persistence in the pursuit of rewards and fun seeking. Therefore, it is possible that the limited planning abilities, that drove more impulsive participants toward disadvantageous decisions, did not affect the choice behavior of individuals who scored high in Reward Sensitivity. Although this post-hoc hypothesis requires further investigation, recent findings are consistent with such a possibility [29] , in that they show that gain amount manipulations selectively interact with BAS Reward Responsiveness in affective decision contexts in which reward amount, loss amount and loss probability are kept separate, through a full factorial design.  In line with our predictions, regression analyses have shown that high levels of BIS-Anxiety seem to improve performance on the IGT-v. It is likely that those who scored highly in this trait, by experiencing greater levels of anxiety in the highly punitive contingencies of disadvantageous decks, were more inclined to avoid them. This preliminary result, considered in conjunction with the effects in the opposite direction previously found for this trait in the original IGT (i.e., worse performance for more anxious individuals; e.g., [4] , [30] , [31] ), may suggest that some variables in the decision context can be crucial in determining whether specific personality variables favor or impair decision making. Although further data are needed to validate this finding, such a pattern stresses the importance of the decision context variables (in this case, the magnitude of immediate punishments) in determining the extent to which specific personality traits can alter decision behaviors. In this respect, we think that a very fruitful approach in this field of research – especially given its clinical implications – could be the systematic investigation of the decision context parameters that are able to impact choice behaviors by interacting with specific personality traits (i.e., the magnitude and/or frequency of rewards and punishments). Indeed, under some circumstances, changes in such parameters might explain why individuals with specific personality constellations can switch from advantageous to disadvantageous decision making (or vice versa ).  In conclusion, the current study shows that, by increasing the conflict between short- and long-term gains in the IGT paradigm, the effects exerted by personality on decision making are more likely to emerge. Further studies are needed to test the robustness of these preliminary findings and to estimate the external validity of the IGT-v in predicting other risk behaviors. If further data are found to be in line with our findings, we encourage the deployment of the IGT-v, in lieu of the original IGT, in future investigations of the impact of personality on healthy individuals' choice behavior. Indeed, the IGT-v entirely preserves the original task structure (i.e., it assessed affective decision making under conditions of ambiguity and risk), while at the same time it seems to be more sensitive than the original task version for disclosing personality influences on choice behavior.

Each of the emotional expressions had the same affective valence (unpleasant), but one was high-arousing (expressing anger) and the other low-arousing (expressing sadness). Our results showed that time judgments are highly sensitive to movements in facial expressions and the emotions expressed. Indeed, longer perceived durations were found in response to the dynamic faces and the high-arousing emotional expressions compared to the static faces and low-arousing expressions. In addition, the facial movements amplified the effect of emotions on time perception. Dynamic facial expressions are thus interesting tools for examining variations in temporal judgments in different social contexts.

Indeed, the flexibility of temporal behaviors in social interaction is an indicator of the efficiency of social adaptation, [1] , [2] , [3] . An individual who is unable to anticipate the actions of others, who always responds too late or too early, is socially inept. According to studies of facial expressions, emotions perceived in others play a critical role in making it possible to understand their behavioral intentions. One important component of the perception of facial expressions is indeed the readiness to act in order to enter into a relationship with others, [4] , [5] , [6] . Action readiness is defined as the predisposition of individuals to engage in a social relationship with others by either approaching or avoiding them, [7] . When somebody expresses anger, and might therefore become aggressive, there is an automatic readiness to act defensively in order to ensure survival, [8] . The arousal level increases, the pupils dilate, the heart accelerates, and the muscles contract. The whole body is mobilized to be ready to act as quickly as possible, i.e., to escape or to attack. In contrast, there is less urgency for action when confronted with a sad person, although it is also important to act in order to comfort or help this person, [9] .  A number of recent studies in psychology have used a temporal bisection task to investigate the effect of facial expressions on time judgments, [10] , [11] , [12] , [13] , [14] , [15] , [16] . In this task, participants are presented with a short ( S ) and a long ( L ) standard duration in the form of a simple oval. In a testing phase, they are then presented with comparison durations of similar or intermediate lengths. Their task is to judge whether the comparison durations are more similar to S or L . However, in the testing phase, the comparison durations are presented in the form of emotional facial expressions. The results have shown distortions in temporal judgments of emotional expressions compared to neutral expressions, [17] , [18] . Nevertheless, the type of temporal distortion depends on the emotion perceived. When the faces express a secondary emotion of shame, a shortening effect occurs, with the presentation duration of ashamed faces being judged shorter than that of neutral expressions, [19] . Ogden [20] also showed that the perception of attractive faces shortens subjective time. This shortening effect is explained by the fact that these facial expressions divert attention away from the processing of time. According to the internal clock models, [21] , [22] , [23] , the representation of time is determined by the number of temporal units (pulses) emitted by a pacemaker-like system, and accumulated during the presentation of a stimulus. Temporal units are therefore lost when attention is distracted away from the processing of time. In contrast, a lengthening effect occurs in response to the expressions of anger or fear, [10] , [12] , [14] , [15] . Within the framework of the internal clock models, this lengthening effect has been explained in terms of the increase in the arousal level induced by the perception of the emotions of anger and fear which speed up the internal clock mechanism underlying the representation of time: The greater the number of temporal units, the longer the stimulus duration is judged to be. As Droit-Volet and Meck [13] have argued, this time dilatation results from the speeding up of the internal clock mechanism, one of the main functions of which is to allow subjects to prepare for action quickly. This effect has been observed in children as young as 3 years of age, thus suggesting that this is an automatic process, [24] . The extent of this subjective lengthening of time in response to the perception of facial expressions has nevertheless been found to be smaller for the emotions of happiness and sadness (and even absent in the case of sadness) than for those of anger and fear, [12] , [13] , [14] . To explain these results, the authors suggested that happy and sad faces are less arousing and that the rate of acceleration of the internal clock system is therefore less rapid.  However, even though studies of time perception in response to facial expressions have revealed significant effects on time judgments, these are still relatively weak, even in the case of high-arousing facial expressions such as the expression of anger. Like most studies of facial expressions, these studies have used photographs of static faces expressing intense emotion. However, if the understanding of the behavioral intentions of others is important for action readiness and its effect on the internal clock mechanisms, we can suppose that the perception of moving faces will increase emotional effects on time judgments. Indeed, individuals habitually make use of their perception of other people's movements to predict their behavior, [25] . As we discuss later, several studies have shown that the emotions of moving faces are judged to be more intense and realistic than those of static faces, and that the dynamic display of facial expressions enhances the accuracy of emotion recognition, [26] , [27] , [28] , [29] . The dynamic aspects of facial behaviors have been neglected in studies of facial expressions [30] and have never been investigated in the time perception field. Our study is therefore original in attempting to examine the influence of dynamic aspects of emotional facial expressions on the perception of time. Our question is: are the distortions in judgments of time in response to emotional expressions greater when facial expressions are presented dynamically (morph movie) than when they are presented statically? Two experiments were run in our study. The first experiment tested the effect on time perception of movements in facial expression and the emotions expressed. In a temporal bisection task, the participants had thus to judge the presentation duration of emotional facial expressions presented either in a dynamic or a static display in comparison to a neutral facial expression, i.e., with no facial movement. Two emotional facial expressions were tested (anger and sadness) because they had the same affective valence (unpleasant), but one was considered as high-arousing (expressing anger) and the other as low-arousing (expressing sadness). The affective dimension and the arousal level induced by the perception of dynamic and static facial expressions were also assessed using the Self-Assessment Manikin scale (SAM), [31] . The second experiment compared these two emotional facial expressions (anger vs. sadness) when they were presented dynamically in the same bisection task or statically.   Experiment 1   Method   Participants  The participants consisted of 104 undergraduate psychology students at Blaise Pascal University (Clermont-Ferrand, France). They received a course credit and signed a formal agreement to participate in this experiment which was approved by the Clermont-Ferrand Sud-Est VI Statutory Ethics Committee (Comité de protection des Personnes (CPP) Sud-Est 6, France) according to the articles of law L. 1121-1-2 and R 1121-3.   Materials  The participants were tested individually in a quiet room and were seated 50 cm from a PC screen. An E-prime program (1.2. psychology Software Tools, Pittsburgh, PA) controlled the experiment and recorded the data. Participants gave their responses by pressing two keys on the computer keyboard, “d” (response “Short”) and “k” (response “Long”), with the button-press assignment being counterbalanced across subjects. During the training phase, the stimulus to be timed was an oval with a mottled texture (white, gray, black) presented on a black background in the center of the computer screen. During the testing phase, the temporal stimuli consisted of faces presented on the same black background. These were taken from a validated set of images ranging from a neutral to an intense emotional expression for different facial identities, [32] . The faces of three different women expressing the emotions of anger and sadness as well as a neutral expression were chosen for our experiment. The image of the most intense facial expression (150% intensity) was presented during the tested duration stimulus in the static condition. In the dynamic condition, in order to generate a dynamic emotional expression from a set of pictures morphed from the neutral to the most intense emotional expression (150 % intensity), a sequence of 17 different images of 12 ms each was used. These images increased in emotional intensity (0%, 5%, 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 100%, 110%, 120%, 130%, 140%, 150%) in accordance with Benson and Perrett's morphing technique, [33] . The facial movement took 204 ms in each dynamic presentation and was followed by the continued display of the image corresponding to the most intense facial expression used in the static condition. The presentation duration of this last image depended on the tested duration. For the neutral expressions, which by definition did not involve a facial movement (no-facial expression), we decided to use the same images of neutral faces in both the dynamic and the static condition.   Procedure  The participants were assigned to one of the four experimental groups: (1) dynamic-anger, (2) dynamic-sadness, (3) static-anger and (4) static-sadness. In each group, the participants were presented with a neutral facial expression and an emotional facial expression (anger or sadness), with the presented emotional expressions being either dynamic or static depending on the experimental group. The procedure was similar in the 4 experimental groups. The participants were initially trained to respond “short” or “long” on 10 trials after experiencing the short (0.4 s) and the long (1.6 s) standard duration (5 trials per duration) presented in the form of an oval. They were then presented with 7 different comparison durations (0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0, 1.2, 1.4 and 1.6 s) presented in the form of neutral or emotional facial expressions. The participants' task was to judge whether the comparison duration was more similar to the “short” or the “long” standard duration. Each participant completed 9 trials for each comparison duration presented with the neutral and the emotional facial expression (7×2). The 9 trials consisted of 3 trials for each of the 3 female faces. The total number of trials was thus 126 trials presented in a random order in each block of 42 trials (3 females faces ×7 comparison durations ×2 facial expressions). Each trial started when the participant pressed the space bar after seeing the word “ready!” displayed on the screen after an inter-trial interval which was randomly chosen between 0.5 s and 1.0 s.  At the end of the experimental session, the participants used the 9-point scale of the Self-Assessment Manikin (SAM) [31] to rate the neutral and emotional expression of the three faces they had seen in the bisection task: (1) for their affective valence - from unpleasant to pleasant, and (2) for their arousal level - from low-arousal to high-arousal. The presentation duration of the facial expressions was at the mid-point between the short and the long standard durations, i.e., 1.0 s. In each group, the participants therefore rated 6 different emotional stimuli presented in a random order (3 faces ×2 emotions).   Results   Emotional assessment of facial expressions  Figure 1 shows the emotional ratings for the different emotional and neutral facial expressions used in the four experimental groups when the emotional facial expressions (results averaged over the three female faces) were presented in a dynamic and a static display. An ANOVA was run on arousal and affective valence ratings with the emotion (neutral vs. emotional expression) as a within-subjects factor and the experimental group as a between-subjects factor. The results of 6 out of the 104 participants were not included because they did not respond to these scales. The ANOVA on arousal showed a significant main effect of emotion, F (1, 94)  = 65.85, p  = .0001, and group, F (3, 94)  = 3.08, p  = .03, as well as a significant emotion x group interaction, F (3, 94)  = 33.14, p  = 0001. The analyses for each experimental group taken separately revealed that the facial expressions of anger were systematically judged more arousing than the neutral expression both in the dynamic and the static condition (Bonferroni tests, both p <.05). For the expressions of anger, no significant difference in arousal was observed between the dynamic and the static presentation (Bonferroni test, p >.05). In contrast, the facial expressions of sadness tended to be judged as low-arousing when presented dynamically but not statically, with the sad expressions being rated as less arousing than the neutral expressions in the dynamic condition ( p <.05), and similarly low-arousing in the static condition ( p >.05). As would be expected because the neutral stimuli were identical in the two conditions, no difference was observed in the arousal judgments for the neutral expressions presented in the static and the dynamic condition.  10.1371/journal.pone.0097944.g001 Figure 1  Arousal and affective valence ratings of neutral and emotional facial expressions presented in a dynamic and a static display.   The ANOVA on the affective valence ratings also showed a significant main effect of emotion, F (1, 94)  = 144.72, p  = .0001, and a significant emotion x group interaction, F (3, 94)  = 2.89, p  = .04, while the main effect of group did not reach significance, F (3, 94)  = 1.95, p  = .13. The significant interaction between emotion and group indicated that the participants systematically judged the angry and sad expressions to be less pleasant than the neutral expressions (Bonferroni tests, both p <.05). However, no difference between groups (dynamic vs. static) was found for the neutral expressions or for the sad or the angry expressions (Bonferroni, all p >.05).  In sum, as the self-assessment of emotions induced by the perception of facial expressions suggests, the angry expressions were judged to be more arousing than the sad expressions, whereas their affective valence was judged similar. The static-dynamic mode of presentation of the images did not change the arousal ratings, except in the case of the sad expressions, which were judged to be less arousing than the neutral expressions in the dynamic condition.   Temporal performance  Figure 2 presents the psychophysical functions with the proportion of long responses - p (long) - plotted against the comparison durations in the 4 experimental groups. This figure reveals an important effect of the dynamic features of facial expressions on time judgments. Indeed, irrespective of the emotion in question, the psychophysical functions shifted toward the left for the emotional expressions presented dynamically compared to the neutral expressions (i.e., with no facial expression). In addition, the magnitude of this leftward shift seems to have been larger for the angry than for the sad expressions. An initial ANOVA run on p (long) revealed a significant interaction between emotion and experimental group, F (3, 100)  = 11.79, p  = .0001. Therefore, in order to account better for variations in the shape of the psychophysical functions, we calculated two temporal parameters: the Bisection Point (BP) and the Weber Ratio (WR) ( Table 1 ). The BP is the point of subjective equality, that is the stimulus duration for which subjects respond long as often as short, p (long) = .50. The WR is the difference limen - (D( p (long)  = .75) - D( p (long)  = .25)) /2 - divided by the BP. This is an index of time sensitivity: The lower the WR, the steeper the psychophysical function and the higher the temporal sensitivity. These two parameters were derived from the significant fit of the individual data with the pseudo-logistic function (mean R 2  = .95, ES  = .005, p <.05), which provided good fits for the bisection data in different conditions, [34] , [35] . For 4 out of 104 participants, this pseudo-logistic fit was not significant because their bisection curves were too flat or not orderly. The results for these 4 participants were thus excluded from the subsequent statistical analyses. The ANOVA on the WR did not show any significant results (all p >.05), thus suggesting that time sensitivity did not change with the type of emotional expression and associated presentation modality (static vs. dynamic). In contrast, the ANOVA on the BP revealed a significant main effect of emotion, F (1, 96)  = 40.72, p  = .0001, and a significant interaction between emotion and group, F (3, 96)  = 6.34, p  = .001, while the effect of group did not reach significance, F (3, 96)  = .65, p  = .58. As Table 1 indicates, when the presentation of facial expressions was static, the BP was lower for the angry than for the neutral expressions (Bonferroni, p <.05), whereas it was similar for the sad and the neutral expressions ( p >.05). In line with the results of previous studies, this confirms that a lengthening effect occurred when the participants were presented with high-arousing facial expressions (anger). When the facial emotional expressions were presented dynamically, a temporal lengthening effect was observed for all emotional expressions (high- or low-arousing) compared to the neutral expression with no facial movement. Indeed, the BP was lower for the emotional expressions (anger or sadness) than for the neutral expressions (Bonferroni, both p <.05). However, contrary to what is suggested in Figure 2 , the difference in the contrast between the BP values for the neutral and angry expressions, on the one hand, and the neutral and sad expressions, on the other, did not reach significance ( p >.05). This indicates that facial movements have a major influence on time judgment, independently of the nature of the emotions perceived. This important effect of facial movements on time perception (with the dynamic faces associated with the emotional expressions and the no-dynamic faces associated with the neutral expression) have probably masked the effects of emotions per se on time perception. Therefore, a second experiment was carried out using 2 emotional expressions (anger and sadness) presented dynamically in the same bisection task (group 1). The same emotional faces were also presented in the static condition for comparison (group 2).  10.1371/journal.pone.0097944.g002 Figure 2  Proportion of long responses plotted against the comparison durations (s) for the neutral facial expression and the emotional (anger or sadness) facial expressions presented in a dynamic and a static display.  10.1371/journal.pone.0097944.t001 Table 1  Mean (Error Standard) Bisection Point and Weber Ratio for the neutral facial expression and the emotional facial expressions presented in a dynamic and a static display.

These participants thus received a course credit and signed a formal agreement to participate in this second experiment which was also approved by the Sud-Est VI Statutory Ethics Committee (CPP), France.  The material and the procedure were also similar to those used in Experiment 1, except that the participants were assigned to one of two groups (dynamic vs. static display), with the angry and the sad expressions being presented in the same bisection task. The sad and angry expressions were thus displayed dynamically to the dynamic group, and statically to the static group.   Results   Emotional assessment of facial expressions  Table 2 shows the participants' ratings of facial expressions in terms of arousal and affective valence. In line with the results of Experiment 1, the ANOVA performed on arousal with emotion and group as factors revealed a main effect of emotion, F (1, 82)  = 96.47, p  = .0001, indicating that the angry faces ( M  = 4.95, ES  = .14) were judged to be more arousing that the sad faces ( M  = 3.43, ES  = .12). The main effect of group and the emotion x group interaction were not significant ( F (1, 82)  = 2.39 and 0.01, respectively, p >.05), indicating that the movement did not change the assessment of the arousal level of emotional facial expressions. There was also a main effect of emotion on affective valence, F (1, 82)  = 12.65, p  = .0001, with no other significant effect being observed, thus demonstrating that the sad faces were judged less pleasant than the angry faces.  10.1371/journal.pone.0097944.t002 Table 2  Mean (Error standard) arousal and affective valence for facial expressions of sadness and anger presented in a dynamic and a static display.

On the contrary, the dynamic display of facial expressions seems to amplify the differences between the angry and the sad expressions relative to the static display of the same expressions. As in the case of Experiment 1, an ANOVA was conducted on the BP and the WR derived from the fit of the individual functions with the pseudo-logistic function that provided a good fit with our data (mean R 2  = .95, ES  = .007, p <.05) (see Table 3 ). The ANOVA on the WR showed neither a main effect of emotion, F (1, 82)  = 0.76, p  = .39, and group, F (1, 82)  = 1.63, p  = .21, nor any interaction between emotion and group, F (1, 82)  = 0.94, p  = .33. The ANOVA on the BP revealed a significant main effect of emotion, F (1, 82)  = 42.43, p  = .0001, which clearly demonstrates that the presentation duration of faces was judged longer for the highly arousing emotion of anger than for the less arousing emotion of sadness. In addition, both the main effect of group, F (1, 82)  = 5.36, p  = .02, and the group x emotion interaction were significant, F (1, 82)  = 5.37, p  = .02. There was indeed a significant effect of emotion in the dynamic, F (1, 41)  = 46.16, p  = .001, as well in the static condition, F (1, 41)  = 7.62, p  = .01. However, the significant interaction indicated that the magnitude of the difference in the BP between the sad and the angry faces was larger in the dynamic than in the static condition, F (1, 82)  = 5.39, p  = .02. This result demonstrated that the difference between the time judgments elicited for the high-arousing and the low-arousing emotional expressions was bigger for moving faces than for static faces. In other words, the perception of movements in facial expressions increases the emotional effects on time judgments which are already observed with static images.  10.1371/journal.pone.0097944.g003 Figure 3  Proportion of long responses plotted against the comparison durations (s) for the facial expressions of anger and sadness presented in a dynamic and a static display.  10.1371/journal.pone.0097944.t003 Table 3  Mean (Error Standard) Bisection Point and Weber Ratio for the perception of emotional facial expressions presented in a dynamic and a static display.

This shift was accompanied by a significant lowering of the bisection point which indicates that time was judged longer in response to angry faces. In contrast, no difference in time judgments was observed between the sad and the neutral expressions. The self-assessment of arousal level induced by the perception of facial expressions indicated that the angry faces were judged as more arousing than the sad and the neutral faces, with no significant difference being observed between these latter two expressions. Consequently, we can conclude that the lengthening effect obtained for angry faces compared to the sad or the neutral faces was related to the increase in subjects' arousal levels. This finding is entirely consistent with the results of previous studies using emotion facial expressions, but also with those of studies using other high-arousal emotional stimuli, such as emotional pictures from the international affective pictures system (IAPS) [36] , [37] , [38] , [39] , [40] , sounds from the International Affective Digital Sounds (IADS) [41] , [42] , or musical pieces [43] . Recently, Gil and Droit-Volet [37] manipulated the arousal level of emotional pictures (IAPS) depicting different discrete emotions (disgust, fear) and obtained evidence in support of the fundamental role of physiological activation in the way emotions influence the perception of time by leading individuals to judge emotional stimuli to be longer than neutral stimuli. However, the mechanisms underlying this emotional lengthening effect are still a matter of debate, [18] . Most researchers have suggested that the increase of physiological activation under the effects of high-arousal emotions is associated with the speeding up of brain mechanisms (pacemaker, temporal oscillators) that underlie the representation of time, [10] , [12] , [42] . In other words, an increase in arousal would speed up the internal clock rate, i.e., the rate at which pulses are accumulated. However, other researchers have suggested that the increase in arousal level is associated to a focus of attention on the processing of the duration of presented stimuli [39] . Indeed, when the arousal level increases in the case of a threatening situation, individuals not only prepare to act (by attacking or fleeing), but also pay more attention to potentially dangerous incoming stimuli [44] . It is therefore difficult to dissociate these mechanisms (arousal and attention) which are closely related. Whatever the case, our results provide additional data demonstrating that the perception of faces expressing a high-arousal emotion lengthens the perceived duration.  More interestingly, the originality of our study lies in showing that the perception of facial movements increased the temporal lengthening effect obtained with high-arousal emotional facial expressions. More precisely, the results of Experiment 1, comparing static with dynamic faces revealed that, per se, the perception of facial movements affects the perception of time. The moving faces were indeed judged to have been presented for longer than the static faces, irrespective of the emotion expressed by these faces. The psychophysical functions shifted toward the left and the BP was lower for the moving faces than for the static faces. However, the results of Experiment 2 relating to the effects of facial expressions of anger and sadness in the same bisection task, and using the same dynamic display, demonstrated that the dynamic presentation of facial expressions amplifies the lengthening effect linked to emotion. As far as the effect of facial movements on time judgments is concerned, our study is the first to show major distortions in such judgments in response to facial movements. However, these results with social stimuli replicate the findings of earlier studies testing the effects of stimulus motion on perceived time with different non-social stimuli (dots, rotation of sphere), [45] , [46] , [47] . The influence of motion on perceived time has indeed been a familiar phenomenon ever since the works of Piaget [48] and Fraisse [49] who identified time distortions in children and adults when viewing moving stimuli. For instance, in a temporal bisection task, Beckmann and Young [45] showed that the duration of a film of a rotating sphere was perceived to be longer than that of a static sphere, and that the BP value decreased with the increase in rotation speed. The question raised here is: what produces this lengthening effect with moving stimuli? The response is far from clear. It could be suggested that the perception of dynamic stimuli increases the rate of the pacemaker mechanism described in the internal clock models [50] . However, testing a series of models, Beckmann and Young [45] observed that the pacemaker-related parameters did not sufficiently capture the effects of stimulus dynamics on perceived time. They thus assumed that motion enhances the way participants track time. More recently, Matthews, Stewart and Wearden [51] referred to this idea to explain their own results on the influence of context (i.e., the difference between stimulus and background) in which a stimulus is presented on the perception of its duration. They thus argued that the flow of pulses into the accumulator during the processing of time depends on the amount of attention paid to the stimulus, with a greater amount of attention paid to the stimuli when they are more different from the background context. The flow of pulses would thus be greater in response to moving than to static stimuli because more attention is focused on dynamic changes. Consequently, one may suppose that the tracking of time would be better for moving faces than for static faces, and that this would be true for all dynamic stimuli.  However, as reported above, our results not only showed a significant main effect of facial movements on time perception, but also a significant interaction between facial movements and expressed emotions (Experiment 2). In other words, the dynamic presentation of faces increased the differences between the perceived duration of emotions. Wang and Yi Jiang [52] observed a greater dilatation in time judgments in bisection when using a motion sequence produced by a point-light walker compared to a non-biological motion or a static picture with the same number of point lights. Their results suggest that the influence of motion on human beings' temporal judgments is greater in the case of biological motion. In our study, the type of dynamic stimuli used, which consisted of a facial movement followed by a static expression did not constitute a genuinely ecological situation. Nevertheless, and in line with Wang and Yi Jiang's [52] findings, our data on facial expressions suggest that humans' time judgments are sensitivity to movements produced by other people. Most studies of facial expressions have shown that dynamic information is beneficial for the processing of emotional expressions, [30] . Dynamic displays of facial expressions do indeed improve performance on emotion recognition tasks compared to static displays of the same facial expressions, [53] , [29] . However, as Krumhuber et al. [30] have argued, the beneficial effects of dynamic information are greater when static information is inefficient or unavailable. Indeed, static faces that express high-intensity emotions provide enough emotional signals for the identification of the respective emotions, [53] , [54] , [55] , [29] . The dynamic presentation of facial expressions would therefore seem to be more useful in ambiguous situations or for the identification of emotions by people with neurological or developmental disorders (brain damage or autism). For example, Harwood, Hall and Shinkfield [56] found that emotion recognition among subjects with mental retardation improved in response to moving facial expressions. Consistently with this idea, our results showed that the perception of movements in facial expressions increases, but does not change the nature of the emotional effects on time judgments, already observed with static images. Indeed, the static images of high emotional intensity (150 %) used in our study were sufficiently arousing to generate a significant lengthening effect.  The mechanisms involved in the processing of moving emotional facial expressions are complex and their effects on time must be further examined. Nevertheless, three main explanations can be proposed. Firstly, the increase in time distortions in response to facial movement could be due to the fact that this motion increases the intensity and arousal of perceived emotions, [57] . However, in our study, the rating of the arousal level induced by facial expressions did not vary between the dynamic and static displays. Secondly, as suggested by Matthews et al. [51] and Beckmann and Young [45] , the motion could increase the amount of attention paid to stimuli, and therefore also to their emotional characteristics. Thirdly, it has been demonstrated that facial movements facilitate the mimicry of facial expressions and their internal simulation, [58] , [59] , [51] , [28] . For instance, the differences between genuine and false smiles (spontaneous vs. deliberate) are detected better in dynamic than in static displays [58] . However, when the participants in a morphing task held a pen in their mouths that prevented them from mimicry, they could no longer detect the authenticity of smiles, [59] . Similarly, Effron, Niedenthal, Gil and Droit-Volet [60] showed that the lengthening effect observed in response to angry faces in a temporal bisection task disappeared when the participants could not perform facial mimicry because they were holding a pen in their mouths. It is thus possible that the moving faces might have facilitated the processes that accelerate the internal clock through the mimicry of perceived facial movements. Imaging studies conducted in the field of social neuroscience have shown that the judgment of emotions is associated with the activation of the motor and premotor cortex, [25] . As demonstrated by Adolphs and coworkers, the emotional and motor components of perceived facial expressions generate both a somatosensory and a motor representation of these facial expressions, [61] , [62] . Subjective time distortions would consequently be an implicit indicator of individual adaptive abilities to attune to others' movements (actions) and/or of action readiness. This idea that the motor component of emotional expressions has a major influence on the perception of time is also consistent with the results of studies that have found time dilatations in response to photographs of body postures, [18] , [63] , [64] . For instance, Nather et al. [63] showed to their participants pictures of Edgar Degas' sculptures of a ballerina in different positions, and found that the presentation duration of a body position representing an expansive movement (movement of the great arabesque) was judged longer than that of a body posture with no movement (ballerina at rest). Within the framework of the theory of embodied time, [3] , [18] , [64] , the authors explained their results in terms of the internal simulation of the body movements that underlie the perceived posture, along with its temporal properties, namely an internal clock that runs faster in the case of motor execution. This echoes Wittmann and Craig's theories on the activation of insula in temporal tasks and the role of proprioceptive information in the explicit experience of time, [65] , [66] , [67] . The direct experience or the reactivation of the experience (simulation) of other people's actions and movements would thus lie at the heart of time distortions in social contexts. However, further data are required if we are to validate this “embodied time” hypothesis and reject a simple attention-based hypothesis.  In conclusion, our results showed that time judgments are highly sensitive to movements in facial expressions as well as to the expressed emotions. Indeed, longer perceived durations were found for the dynamic faces and high-arousing emotional expressions than for the static faces and low-arousing facial expressions. Furthermore, our results showed that facial movements amplify the emotional effect of facial expressions on the perception of time. Dynamic emotional stimuli are thus interesting tools for examining time judgments and their variations in different social contexts. However, methodological precautions must be taken if we are to successfully identify the respective contributions of the dynamic structure of stimuli and their emotional characteristics.

This study examined whether individuals with different personality types (i.e., overcontrollers, undercontrollers, resilients) had different friendship quality development throughout adolescence. It also investigated whether personality types were indirectly related to romantic relationship quality in young adulthood, via friendship quality development in adolescence. The study employed six waves of longitudinal questionnaire data from Dutch youths who had a romantic relationship when they were young adults. Two age cohorts were followed, from 12 to 21 years and from 16 to 25 years, respectively. Findings showed that resilients reported higher mean levels of friendship quality during adolescence (i.e., more support from, less negative interaction with and less dominance from their best friend) than both overcontrollers and undercontrollers. Through the mean levels of friendship quality throughout adolescence, resilients indirectly experienced higher romantic relationship quality during young adulthood than both overcontrollers and undercontrollers. Thus, results provide support for a developmental model in which adolescent friendship quality is a mechanism linking personality types with young adulthood romantic relationship quality.   The present study used data of the CONAMORE (CONflict And Management Of RElationships) study. CONAMORE has been financially supported by various grants from the Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO), the Research Centre Adolescent Development of Utrecht University, and various other grants from Utrecht University. The funders had no role in study design, data collection and analysis, decision to publish, or preparation of the manuscript. info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0102078.g004  Introduction  Friendships and romantic relationships are both important for psychosocial development in adolescence and young adulthood [1] , [2] . Both of these social relationships are voluntary and reciprocal, and thus have important characteristics in common. Friendships and romantic relationships also vary in the developmental significance over the life course, however. Whereas friendships are often the first voluntary and reciprocal relationship in a persons’ life, and fulfill important developmental needs during childhood and adolescence, romantic relationships typically become more salient during emerging adulthood [3] , [4] . As such, friendships may serve as a learning ground for later romantic relationships [5] , [6] . In other words, success in friendships is likely to affect the mastery of romantic relationships.  Not all adolescents and young adults develop optimal and satisfactory relationships. For instance, it has been proposed and empirically demonstrated that personality affects both individuals’ friendships and romantic relationships [3] , [7] , [8] . Generally, adolescents with a resilient personality tend to have both better friendships in adolescence and better romantic relationships in young adulthood [9] , [10] . However, there are some gaps in our understanding of how these differences arise over the course of adolescence and emerging adulthood. Firstly, although prior research has shown linkages between personality and friendship quality, findings are inconclusive, mainly due to the fact that linkages have been studied across limited developmental periods. Secondly, to our best knowledge, it is unknown whether personality affects later romantic relationship quality through earlier friendship quality development, despite the fact that developmental “spill-over” between friendships and romantic relationships is plausible. The present study attempted to fill these gaps by drawing on insights from individual personality differences and developmental perspectives together.   Personality Types and Quality of Social Relationships  Both friendship and romantic relationship quality might vary as a function of personality. People with different personality traits can differ in their motivations, as well as their interactions in and perceptions of social relationships [11] , [12] . For instance, agreeable persons tend to have stronger motives for maintaining positive social relationships and try to minimize interpersonal disputes by being less aggressive, and therefore experience higher relationship quality [13] , [14] . Additionally, people who are low in emotional stability are more likely to interpret ambiguous relationship scenarios in a more negative way, and to experience lower relationship quality [15] . Hence, there are clear empirical indications that personality is indeed linked to the quality of social relationships. However, variable-centered studies can only partially address this issue. Such an approach cannot unravel differences in social relationship quality for people who are both agreeable and emotionally unstable, for instance. Since separate dimensions of personality do not describe the person as a whole, there is a growing recognition of the need for a person-centered approach to understand personality and its associations with individuals’ relational outcomes [16] , [17] .   Personality types  One of the most often applied person-centered approaches to personality was based on Block and Block’ (1980) theory on ego-control and ego-resilience. Ego-control refers to the tendency to contain versus express motivational impulses, and ego-resiliency refers to the tendency to respond flexibly to environmental demands. Studies have suggested that three personality types–resilients, undercontrollers, and overcontrollers–could be constructed as specific combinations of ego-control and ego-resilience [13] , [18] . Specifically, resilients are characterized by a high level of ego-resiliency and a medium level of ego-control. Overcontrollers and undercontrollers both have a low level of ego-resiliency, but differ on ego-control. Overcontrollers have a high level of ego-control and undercontrollers have a low level of ego-control [17] , [18] . Several studies have revealed that these three personality types can be reliably constructed using Big Five personality traits in adolescents [19] , [20] . Resilients generally have higher scores on all five dimensions: Extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, emotional stability, and openness. Undercontrollers are characterized by lower conscientiousness and agreeableness, compared to others. Overcontrollers typically have relatively lower extraversion and lower emotional stability, compared to others, yet comparable agreeableness as Resilients [17] , [18] , [20] . We will adopt this personality classification to understand how individuals with these three distinct personality types vary in their social relationships.   Relationship quality  Social relationships have both positive and negative features [21] , [22] . On the one hand, social relations can be salient sources of support by providing companionship, intimacy, assistance, and guidance. On the other hand, relationships provide a context for negative interactions, such as conflict and antagonism among interpersonal partners. A third feature that needs to be distinguished to understand relationships is the perceived dominance in the relationship, that is, the extent to which one is controlled and dominated by the other [23] . Although there are other aspects of a social relationship that are important, we focus on these three dimensions as they together encompass both positive and negative features of a social relationship. Moreover, these three dimensions provided a common conceptual framework among various types of relationships in the social network [24] , [25] . Therefore, in the current study, perceived support from, negative interaction with, and perceived dominance from interpersonal partners, are the key dimensions adopted to typify friendships over the course of adolescence and romantic relationships in emerging adulthood.   Personality Types and Friendship Quality in Adolescence  Research has shown that individuals with different personality types might have distinct patterns of friendship quality. Resilients tend to have better quality of friendships than both overcontrollers and undercontrollers [7] , [10] . More specifically, cross-sectional studies using adolescent samples with average ages varying from 12 to 17 years have shown that resilients perceived more support from their friends than both overcontrollers and undercontrollers, whereas between the latter two there were no significant differences [26] , [27] . A longitudinal study examining this link among adolescents from 13 to 16 years showed similar findings [10] . Furthermore, one study followed adolescents from 12 to 16 years and showed that overcontrollers and undercontrollers were equally high in conflict frequency and hostile conflict management, and they were both significantly higher in these two aspects than resilients [28] . Former research also provides some evidence regarding different levels of perceived dominance from friends for youths with different personality types. Overcontrollers experienced more coercion from their friend, and they were more likely to comply with their best friend in conflict and be influenced by their best friend’s delinquency than resilients [10] , [28] , [29] . Moreover, overcontrollers scored significantly lower than resilients on social potency which describes the propensity to enjoy leadership roles and desire to influence others [9] . For undercontrollers, results are less consistent: Similar to overcontrollers, they experienced more coercion from their friend and were more likely to comply with their best friend during conflict than resilients [10] , [28] . They did not differ from resilients in their tendency to influence their friend with their delinquent behavior, however, nor in their level of social potency [9] , [29] . In sum, both overcontrollers and undercontrollers seem to perceive less support and more negative interaction in friendships than resilients, and overcontrollers tend to perceive more dominance from friends than resilients. Results are mixed as to whether undercontrollers differ from resilients regarding perceived dominance from friends. All of these studies were limited to early to middle adolescents, however, and predominantly studied differences in terms of mean levels. The current study will examine personality differences in the mean levels of, and the developmental changes in, friendship quality among adolescents from 12 to 20 years.   Personality Types and Romantic Relationship Quality in Emerging Adulthood  Individuals with different personality types also differ in romantic relationship quality. Personality types identified in early childhood were found to predict the quality of romantic relationships in young adulthood [9] , [30] , [31] : Undercontrollers, compared to resilients, reported lower quality of romantic relationships, as indicated by lower emotional support and warmth (e.g., intimacy and trust, acceptance, and exchange of personal thoughts and feelings), higher levels of conflict, and a more unequal balance of power in the relationship. Quite surprisingly, overcontrollers had similarly high romantic relationship quality as resilients in these three studies, despite the fact that overcontrollers generally reported lower friendship quality. Perhaps this absence of differences between overcontrollers and resilients can be explained by the fact that previous studies have assessed personality at one point in early childhood, rather than accounting for adolescent personality and its maturation over the course of adolescence [17] , [20] . As personality develops during childhood and adolescence, personality measured during adolescence might be differently related to romantic relationship quality in young adulthood. Using a developmental personality typology to capture the normative changes of personality in adolescence might help in drawing a more comprehensive picture about the link between personality types and romantic relationship quality.   Adolescent Friendships and Romantic Relationships in Emerging Adulthood  Friendships offer an important training ground for developing capacities and expectations for later romantic relationships [6] , [32] , [33] . Consistent with these theoretical ideas, several longitudinal studies have shown positive linkages between adolescent friendships and emerging adult romantic relationships [3] , [34] – [36] . These studies, with time intervals ranging from 4 years to 7 years, revealed significant associations of weak to moderate effect size for various indicators of quality of friendships and romantic relationships, such as social support, commitment, and hostility. Specifically, individuals’ support from friends at age 15 and 17 was positively related to support from romantic partners at age 21 [36] , and more support from friends at 16 years was predictive of longer-term committed romantic relationship from 18 to 25 years [35] . Similarly, relational commitment in adolescent friendships was predictive of relational commitment to their romantic partner in emerging adulthood [3] . Moreover, positive conflict resolution with friends at age 16 was related to more commitment and less hostility in young adults’ romantic relationships [34] . In sum, existing studies have consistently provided support for the idea that friendship experiences during adolescence might contribute in important ways to the quality of romantic relationships in emerging adulthood.   Personality Types, Adolescent Friendships, and Romantic Relationships in Emerging Adulthood  No prior research has examined why adolescents with different personality types might vary in their quality of romantic relationships in emerging adulthood. As introduced above, previous studies have provided some evidence about the linkages between personality types and friendship quality, although they predominately focused on early to middle adolescents. Additionally, prior research has shown significant linkages between quality of adolescent friendship and young adults’ romantic relationships. These linkages suggest a natural progression for romantic relationship development, in which youths practice principles of volition and reciprocity in friendships and generalize related abilities and expectations to later romantic relationships. This developmental trajectory forms the rationale for an indirect effect of personality types on later romantic relationship quality, through earlier friendship quality. More specifically, we proposed that there would be an indirect pathway, such that adolescent personality types were associated with differential development of friendship quality during adolescence, which in turn would be associated with romantic relationship quality.   The Current Study  Overall, this study aimed to test whether adolescent personality types were related to differential mean levels and developmental changes in friendship quality throughout adolescence (aim 1) and whether, through these differences in adolescents’ friendship quality, adolescent personality types would indirectly predict romantic relationship quality during young adulthood (aim 2).   Method   Participants  Participants were 524 Dutch youths who had a romantic relationship during young adulthood. They were part of an ongoing longitudinal study CONAMORE (CONflict And Management Of RElationships study), which in total consists of 1313 participants divided into two age cohorts. We collected data for one cohort from age 12 onwards (i.e., younger cohort; n  = 923), and for the other cohort from age 16 onwards (i.e., older cohort; n  = 390), respectively. For the current study, we used data from the annual measurements Wave 1 to Wave 5, collected from 2001 to 2005, and Wave 6 data, collected in 2010. Thus, participants were followed for ten years, from 12 to 21 years for the younger cohort and from 16 to 25 years for the older cohort. Because the aim of the study was to explain the quality of romantic relationships in early adulthood, only participants who had a romantic relationship during the sixth measurement wave (Wave 6) were included ( n  = 524). That is, 343 participants (227 girls) out of the initial 923 participants from the younger cohort, and 181 participants (112 girls) out of the initial 390 participants from the older cohort were included. The mean ages of these subsamples at Wave 1 were 12.37 years ( SD  = 0.56) for the younger cohort and 16.56 years ( SD  = 0.81) for the older cohort. For both cohorts, the ethnic compositions were 91.9% Dutch and 8.1% ethnic minorities. Regarding education levels at Wave 6, 266 participants (77.6%) from the younger cohort and 84 participants (46.4%) from the older cohort were completing further education. There were significant differences between participants who had a relationship at Wave 6 and those who did not, but all of these differences were of small effect size. Specifically, the percentages of girls and native Dutch in the group with a romantic relationship were significantly higher than those in the group without a relationship at Wave 6 (χ 2 [ N =  1313, 1] = 60.92, p <.001, φ = .22; χ 2 [ N =  1267, 1] = 25.41, p <.001, φ = .14). Moreover, after controlling for gender differences, young adults with a romantic relationship at Wave 6 perceived more support from their best friend (F [1, 1099] = 10.61, p <.001, r  = .10), less negative interaction with their best friend, and less dominance from their best friend (F [1, 1105] = 7.31, p  = .01, r  = .08 and F [1, 1083] = 4.83, p =  .03, r  = .07, respectively), than young adults without a romantic relationship. There was a significant difference in the distributions of personality types among those who had a relationship at Wave 6 and those who did not (χ 2 [ N =  1313, 2] = 9.10, p  = .01, φ = .08). Undercontrollers were significantly less likely to have a romantic relation at Wave 6 (χ2 [N = 1313, 1] = 4.35, p  = .04, φ = .06), whereas resilients were significantly more likely to have a romantic relation at Wave 6 (χ2 [N = 1313, 1] = 8.46, p <.001, φ = .08).   Procedure  Participants were initially included from a number of randomly selected high schools in the province of Utrecht, The Netherlands. Participants and their parents received an invitation letter, describing the research project and goals, and giving the option of not participating in the study. More than 99% of the approached adolescents decided to participate in our study. From Wave 1 to Wave 5, our participants annually filled in various questionnaires at school after school hours. Participants who changed schools during measurement of Waves 1 to 5 and participants at Wave 6 filled in the questionnaires at their homes. Trained assistants gave verbal instructions to participants in addition to written instructions in the questionnaires. Confidentiality of participants’ given answers was assured explicitly before participation. Participants received €10 as a reward for their participation from Wave 1 to Wave 5, and €30 in Wave 6.  For participation in the present study, written informed consent was obtained from adolescents and their parents, and also from all the participating schools. Treatment of participants was in accordance with the ethical standards of the APA and this study was reviewed and approved by the ethical-medical committee of University Medical Centre Utrecht, the Netherlands.   Measures   Adolescents’ personality types  Adolescents’ personality was assessed annually for five years with the Quick Big Five questionnaire [37] , [38] . Thirty personality makers were used to assess five personality dimensions (each with 6 items): Extraversion (e.g., “talkative”), Agreeableness (e.g., “sympathetic”), Conscientiousness (e.g., “systematic”), Emotional stability (e.g., “worried”, reverse-scored), and Openness to experience (e.g., “creative”). Adolescents rated their personality on a 7-point Likert scale ranging from 1 ( very untrue ) to 7 ( very true ). Prior research have reported adequate reliability and validity of this scale [39] . In the current study, across Wave 1 to Wave 5, Cronbach’s alphas ranged from .80 to .87 for Extraversion, from .81 to .87 for Agreeableness, from .85 to .91 for Conscientiousness, from .80 to .83 for Emotional stability, and from .76 to .77 for Openness to experience. Several studies have shown that Block and Block’s (1980) three personality types (i.e., overcontrollers, undercontrollers, and resilients) can be constructed directly from the Big Five dimensions [17] , [18] , [20] . An earlier study constructed personality types with Latent Class Growth Analysis (LCGA; [40] ) on the original 1313 cases, including the current sample [41] . The LCGA indicated that a three-class solution fit the data the best and the entropy was .91, which indicated a high accuracy of classification [42] . Therefore, in the current research, we adopted that study’s classification of personality types (See [41] for specific scores on Big Five traits for each personality type). In our sample, there were 120 overcontrollers, 78 undercontrollers, and 145 resilients among the 343 participants in the younger cohort. There were 57 overcontrollers, 53 undercontrollers, and 71 resilients among the 181 participants in the older cohort.   Friendship and romantic relationship quality  Participants’ friendship quality from 12 to 20 years (i.e., from Wave1 to Wave 5) and romantic relationship quality during young adulthood (i.e., 21 and 25 years at Wave 6) were assessed with Network of Relationships Inventory (NRI; [43] ). This inventory measures participants’ perceptions of support from their best friend or romantic partner, negative interaction with their best friend or romantic partner, and perceived dominance from their best friend or romantic partner. Support was assessed with twelve items, including items from different subscales tapping into companionship, instrumental aid, intimacy, nurturance, affection, admiration, and reliable alliance in friendship or in romantic relationship. A sample item was “How often do you turn to this person for support with personal problems?” Negative interaction was measured with six items from two subscales tapping conflict and antagonism. A sample item was “How much do you and this person get upset with or mad at each other?” Perceived dominance was assessed with six items from two subscales tapping the extent to which adolescents were controlled and dominated by their best friend or romantic partner. A sample item was “How often does this person get his/her way when you two do not agree about what to do?” Participants reported their friendship and romantic relationship quality on a 5-point Likert scale, ranging from 1 ( never ) to 5 ( always ). The NRI has good predictive, factorial, and construct validity (Furman, 1996). In the current study, across the five waves, Cronbach’s alphas ranged from .91 to .93 for perceived support from best friend, from .81 to .87 for negative interaction with best friend, and from .81 to .86 for perceived dominance from best friend. At Wave 6, Cronbach’s alphas were .92 for perceived support from romantic partner,. 90 for negative interaction with romantic partner, and .88 for perceived dominance from romantic partner.   Statistical Analyses  All research questions were tested within comprehensive models existing of three groups of variables: 1) adolescent personality types (determined by fives waves of personality data); 2) latent growth factors (i.e., intercepts and slopes) capturing development of adolescent friendship quality across five waves; and 3) emerging adults’ romantic relationship quality. We estimated separate models for each friendship and romantic relationship quality variable. Age cohort was used as a grouping variable. In the model, depicted in Figure 1 , adolescent personality types were entered as two dummy variables (i.e., overcontrollers vs. resilients and undercontrollers vs. resilients, with resilient personality type as a reference category coded as 0). We explored models including a dummy variable for the comparison between overcontrollers and undercontrollers. As only one out of twelve comparisons was significant (in the younger age cohort, overcontrollers experienced higher dominance from friends than undercontrollers), we did not further include results of these models. To test for the proposed structural linkages among these variables, we added paths from the personality dummies to the latent growth factors of friendship quality, paths from adolescent personality to romantic relationship quality in emerging adulthood, and paths from the latent growth factors of adolescent friendship quality to emerging adults’ romantic relationship quality. We additionally controlled for gender on the intercepts and slopes of adolescent friendship quality and on young adulthood romantic relationship quality. The models were tested in M plus  [44] using a maximum likelihood (ML) estimator.  10.1371/journal.pone.0102078.g001 Figure 1  Structural Equation Model Testing the Relations between Adolescent Personality Types, Adolescent Friendship Quality Development, and Young Adulthood Romantic Relationship Quality.   We first determined the shape of growth in friendship quality during adolescence. To that end, we compared the chi-square values of models including a linear and quadratic growth to capture changes in friendship support, negative interaction, and dominance [45] . The tests for negative interaction and dominance indicated that adding quadratic slopes significantly improved model fit (i.e., a significantly lower chi-square value; Δχ 2 [N = 524, 2] = 25.35, p <.001 and Δχ 2 [N = 524, 2] = 18.61, p <.001, respectively). For perceived support, the model with quadratic slope had a similar fit as the linear model (Δχ 2 [N = 524, 2] = 3.21, p  = .20). However, to facilitate the comparability between models across three friendship quality indicators, we chose models with both linear and quadratic slopes. To avoid convergence problems, the variances of quadratic slopes were fixed at zero.  After determining the shape of the growth of friendship quality, we tested whether parameters in the models could be constrained to be equal across cohorts, again by using chi-square difference tests [45] . These parameters included means, variances, and covariances of intercepts and slopes of friendship quality, and all structural regression paths in the models. Because the variance of the quadratic slope was constrainted at zero, no structural parameters could be estimated with this growth factor. In the final models, we constrained each parameter to be equal across two age cohorts that did not result in a significant decrease in chi-square value compared to the unconstrained model. All of the difference tests can be obtained from the first author upon request.  In addition, to evaluate the indirect effects of adolescent personality types on young adulthood romantic relationship quality through initial levels and developmental changes of friendship quality, the bias corrected bootstrapping method proposed by Preacher and Hayes [46] was used, using 10000 bootstrap resamples.  To evaluate the overall goodness of fit of the model, we used the Comparative Fit Index (CFI), the Tucker-Lewis Index (TLI), the Root Mean Squared Error of Approximation (RMSEA), and the Standard Root Mean Square Residual (SRMR). CFI and TLI values of .90 and above, and RMSEA and SRMR values of less than .08 are considered to indicate acceptable fit [47] , [48] .   Results  Table 1 presents the means and standard deviations of Wave 1 to Wave 5 adolescent friendship quality and Wave 6 young adulthood romantic relationship quality, for each adolescent personality type (i.e., overcontrollers, undercontrollers, and resilients). Table 2 presents bivariate intercorrelations between relationship quality indicators. Table 3 and Figures 2 – 4 present the results of our final structural equation models. These models all had an acceptable model fit, with CFIs and TLIs higher than .90, and RMSEAs and SRMRs lower than .08.  10.1371/journal.pone.0102078.g002 Figure 2  Estimated Developmental Changes in Adolescent Friendship Support by Adolescent Personality Types.  10.1371/journal.pone.0102078.g003 Figure 3  Estimated Developmental Changes in Adolescent Friendship Negative Interaction by Adolescent Personality Types.  10.1371/journal.pone.0102078.g004 Figure 4  Estimated Developmental Changes in Adolescents’ Perceived Dominance from Best Friend by Adolescent Personality Types.  10.1371/journal.pone.0102078.t001 Table 1  Means and Standard Deviations of the Observed Values of Adolescent Friendship Quality and Young Adulthood Romantic Relation Quality by Adolescent Personality Types.

Therefore, no regression parameters could be estimated in the structural part of the models. Superscripts b and c indicated that magnitudes of parameters were significantly different across the younger and the older cohorts, thus they were freely estimated across cohorts.  Adolescent Personality Types and Adolescent Friendship Quality  Regarding our first research aim, the findings generally confirmed that the mean levels (i.e., intercepts) of adolescent friendship quality differed by adolescent personality types ( Figures 2 – 4 ). In both cohorts, overcontrollers (unstandardized coefficients [Bs]  =  −0.22, ps <.001) and undercontrollers (Bs  =  −0.32, ps <.001) perceived significantly lower levels of support from their best friend during adolescence than resilients. Regarding negative interaction with best friend during adolescence, overcontrollers (Bs  =  0.08, ps  = .04) and undercontrollers (Bs  =  0.09, ps  = .02) had higher levels of negative interaction than resilients. Moreover, both overcontrollers (Bs  =  0.16, ps <.001) and undercontrollers (B  =  0.14, p  = .03) perceived higher levels of dominance from their best friend during adolescence. For undercontrollers, however, this was found only for the younger age cohort.  Fewer effects were found of the personality types on the developmental changes (i.e., linear slopes). In fact, the only significant finding was that undercontrollers increased significantly faster in perceived dominance from their best friend than resilients (B  =  0.06, p  = .01), in the older age cohort. These results were found while controlling for the fact that girls had significantly higher mean levels (Bs  =  0.54, ps <.001) and slower growth (Bs  =  −0.04, ps  = .03) in perceived friendship support, and significantly lower mean levels of negative interaction with their best friend in adolescence (Bs  =  −0.13, ps <.001) than boys in both cohorts. Overall, the pattern was quite consistent. Whereas almost no differences were found in the developmental changes in friendship quality, resilients reported the highest-quality friendships over the course of adolescence, compared to their overcontrolled or uncontrolled age-mates.   Indirect Effect of Adolescent Personality Types on Young Adults’ Romantic Relationship Quality, through Adolescent Friendship Quality  The second research aim was to determine whether personality types would be linked to romantic relationships through a developmental “spill-over” from earlier friendship quality to later romantic relationship. Indications were found for this indirect linkage, because each of the essential paths constituting this indirect effect was significant. That is, over and above the effects of personality on quality of adolescent friendship, we also found indications for transmission of friendship quality to later romantic relationship quality in emerging adulthood. In fact, these linkages were generally (moderately) strong. Path estimates (βs) from adolescent friendship quality to young adulthood romantic relationship quality ranged from .41 to .56 for support, from .23 to .33 for negative interaction, and from .35 to .39 for perceived dominance.  Moreover, the transmission of the quality of adolescent friendships to young adulthood romantic relationships was further supported when the indirect effect was tested using stringent bootstrapping methods. Despite the fact that there were no direct paths from adolescent personality types on perceived support from, negative interaction with, and perceived dominance from romantic partners in young adulthood (Bs ranged from −0.01 to 0.04, ps> .05), there were significant indirect effects of adolescent personality types on young adulthood romantic relationship quality through the mean levels of adolescent friendship quality. Specifically, resilients indirectly experienced higher mean levels of support from their romantic partners in emerging adulthood than overcontrollers (Bs  =  −0.10, ps <.001) and undercontrollers (Bs  =  −0.14, ps <.001), through mean levels of adolescent friendship support. This was found in both age cohorts. In terms of negative interaction, resilients across cohorts indirectly experienced less negative interaction with romantic partner in young adulthood than overcontrollers (Bs  =  0.04, ps  = .08) and undercontrollers (Bs  =  0.05, ps  = .04), through the mean levels of negative interaction with their best friend in adolescence. Moreover, overcontrollers in both age cohorts indirectly perceived more dominance from romantic partner during young adulthood than resilients (Bs  =  0.10, ps  = .01), through the mean levels in perceived dominance from their best friend in adolescence. In addition, undercontrollers in the younger cohort indirectly experienced more dominance from their romantic partner during young adulthood than resilients (Bs  =  0.09, ps  = .04), through the mean levels in perceived dominance from their best friend during adolescence.  Although these indirect linkages were not observed for the developmental changes in friendship quality, findings provide support for the idea of indirect effects of adolescent personality types on young adulthood romantic relationship quality, through friendship quality in adolescence. Together, these models explained 12% to 27% of variance in the quality of young adults’ romantic relationships. Explained variances were 14% and 26% for perceived support, 12% and 7% for negative interaction, and 23% and 27% for perceived dominance, for the younger and older cohorts respectively. This indicates medium to large effect sizes ( rs ranged from .26 to .52) according to the standards set by Cohen [49] .   Discussion  The current study aimed to provide more insight into the associations between personality types (i.e., overcontrollers, undercontrollers, and resilients), friendship quality in adolescence, and romantic relationship quality in early adulthood. Results showed that both overcontrollers and undercontrollers had lower friendship quality during adolescence than resilients, as indicated by lower perceived support from, more negative interaction with, and more perceived dominance from their best friend. Further, adolescent personality types had an indirect linkage with romantic relationship quality during young adulthood, through perceived quality of friendship during adolescence. These findings suggest that individuals’ personality may play an important role in the continuity of quality of relationships with friends and romantic partners. Results indicate that individual differences in adolescent friendship quality could “spill over” to romantic relationship quality in young adulthood.   Personality Types and Development of Friendship Quality in Adolescence  The current study indicates that adolescents with different personality types differed significantly in the mean levels of all friendship quality indicators across the whole period of adolescence. We also found that undercontrollers grew faster in perceived best friends’ dominance from middle to late adolescence. Perhaps, undercontrollers’ relatively disruptive and impulsive interpersonal behaviors [30] decrease their own opportunities to influence their friends during the transition to young adulthood, as such behaviors become less acceptable over the course of development [50] . As a consequence, they might gradually experience more dominance from their best friends than resilients or overcontrollers do. Except for this difference, we did not find differences in growth rates in any of the other friendship quality indicators by adolescent personality types. Together these findings therefore suggest that the differences in friendship quality by personality types lie mainly in the mean levels.  The results that overcontrollers and undercontrollers perceived lower support and more negative interaction from their best friend were in accordance with the findings in the prior studies covering shorter time spans in adolescence [10] , [26] – [28] . Findings may add to the existing literature by showing that the distinct patterns of perceived support and negative interaction reported by the different personality types were rather persistent across the whole period of adolescence. The reasons behind the relatively higher relationship quality for resilients are not yet clear. One prior study reported that resilients had better understanding of the conceptions of friendship, such as the meaning of closeness and trust between friends, conflict resolution among friends, and the processes through which people become friends [51] . It might be that resilients’ more mature understanding of friendship increases their capabilities for developing and maintaining friendships, and for experiencing more satisfactory friendships, compared to overcontrollers and undercontrollers.  Overcontrollers perceived more dominance from their best friend than resilients throughout adolescence. That is, overcontrollers were less likely to be the leader and take charge in their friendships than resilients. This finding is in accordance with the findings that overcontrollers are generally more compliant during conflicts with their best friend and experience more coercion from their friend than resilients [10] , [28] . The findings are also line with a study reporting that overcontrollers were particularly vulnerable to their best friend’s influence in delinquent behaviors [29] . There might be two reasons for the overcontrollers’ “follower” position in their friendship. First, it might be due to overcontrollers’ low social potency: They are found to be more submissive, not fond of leadership roles, and to have little desire to influence others [9] . As such, it is possible that overcontrollers do not mind if their interpersonal partner (e.g., friend) takes charge in the relationship and dominates them. The other reason could be their low decision-making ability. A recent study has found that overcontrollers scored relatively high on indecisiveness [52] , and it could well be that their friends therefore need to take charge and make decisions for them in the relationship. These two reasons might explain the finding that overcontrollers are more likely to be dominated in their friendships and follow their friends’ delinquent behaviors.  Similar to overcontrollers, undercontrollers also perceived more dominance from their best friend than resilients from early to middle adolescence. This result is in contrast to prior findings indicating that undercontrollers were not different from resilients in their reports of being forceful and being fond of leadership roles, and that they seemed to be capable of influencing delinquent behaviors of their best friend [29] , [53] . The finding, however, is in agreement with studies reporting that undercontrollers were more compliant during conflict with their best friend and perceived more coercion in their friendship than resilients [10] , [28] . It is intriguing that these two lines of evidence regarding undercontrollers’ influence on their friend are contradictory. One possible interpretation of these results is that although undercontrollers generally have the propensity of assuming leadership roles and have the desire to influence others, they are only capable of influencing their best friend with actual behaviors such as delinquency. They do not seem to be proficient in impacting their friend by presenting convincing arguments. One possible reason might be that undercontrollers lack social skills [53] , and therefore are not able to persuade their friend to follow their suggestions. Another reason could be that, like overcontrollers, their relatively higher level of indecisiveness compared to resilients [52] puts their friend in the position of making decisions in the relationship. In sum, undercontrollers might unintentionally impact their friends’ behavior, as their risk-taking may be regarded as evidence of independence and maturation during adolescence, and thus appear attractive to and be copied by their friends [54] . However, undercontrollers might not be able to purposefully influence their friends.   Indirect Effect of Personality Types on Romantic Relationship Quality through Friendship Quality  Our results suggest that adolescent personality types could potentially have an impact on romantic relationship quality during young adulthood, although this impact appears to be indirect, through friendship quality during adolescence. Consistent with prior studies, our study showed that overcontrolled children did not directly differ from resilients in romantic relationship quality during young adulthood [9] , [30] . In contrast, we did not find that undercontrollers directly had more conflicting romantic relationships during young adulthood than resilients.  Although we did not find direct effect of personality types on romantic relationship quality, indirectly, however, undercontrollers, as well as overcontrollers, experienced lower romantic relationship quality than resilients. Specifically, overcontrollers’ and undercontrollers’ lower friendship quality during adolescence, as compared to resilients’, was subsequently related to lower romantic relationship quality during young adulthood. Our study suggests that individuals’ differential levels of quality in friendship during adolescence tend to “spill over” to different levels of quality in romantic relationship during young adulthood. These “spill-over” effects were further suggested by the consistently moderate, significant linkages between friendship quality and romantic relationship quality five years later. These findings provide more insight into potential mechanisms underlying how personality may affect romantic relationship quality. Perceived friendship quality during adolescence might be one of the underlying processes linking personality and perceived romantic relationship quality during emerging adulthood.  Two explanations could be provided for this potential mechanism. First, from an attachment perspective, youths may develop expectancies for interpersonal relationships based on their earlier close relationships [33] , [55] . These expectancies form mental representations (working models) of the self and relationship partners that guide interaction patterns in their later relationships, including romantic ones [56] – [58] . Resilients perceived relatively higher friendship quality in adolescence, and might thus develop representations of themselves as desirable and skillful interpersonal partners. However, overcontrollers and undercontrollers who had lower friendship quality in adolescence might develop internal representations of themselves as undesirable interpersonal partners. These differential expectations, based on earlier interpersonal relationships, might affect their romantic relationship quality. Second, friendships might serve as a place where youths can practice social skills in egalitarian and reciprocal relationships [6] , [32] . These findings thus suggest that overcontrollers and undercontrollers may not have the opportunities to develop such skills in the friendship context during their adolescent years. Therefore, overcontrollers and undercontrollers might enter romantic relationships with fewer social skills learned from prior friendships than resilients, such as abilities to establish intimacy, negotiate in conflict, and balance dominance with their best friend. Ultimately, due to their own poorer relationships skills, they could also end up in romantic relationships of poorer quality. These two potential explanations could unfortunately not be tested in the current study, but are an important area for future research.   Strengths, Limitations, and Future Research Directions  This study has several strengths. It followed two age cohorts of youths over a period of ten years. This allowed us for the first time to examine the link between personality and development of friendship quality throughout adolescence. In addition, the current study provides more insight into the mechanism underlying the link between personality and romantic relationship quality. That is, by integrating personality, friendships, and romantic relationships into one model, this study revealed that personality predicted later romantic relationship through earlier friendship quality development.  Despite these strengths, some limitations of the current study should be mentioned. One limitation lies in the use of single-informant data, which might introduce reporter bias.  Both friendships and romances are dyadic relationships, within which each person’s perceptions and behaviors are important factors to consider. Prior research has shown that the degree of similarity between friends’ and partners’ personality influences the quality of their relationship [59] . Thus future research could explore the relationships between the variables using data from various sources (e.g., both participant and their best friend and romantic partner) to capture a more complete picture. Second, even though we found longitudinal associations between adolescent personality, adolescent friendship quality, and young adulthood romantic relationship quality, we cannot draw causal conclusions due to the design of the study.   Conclusion  Taking together, the current study extends previous research by showing that individuals with different personality types differed in their mean levels of friendship quality during the whole period of adolescence, and through these differences, they might indirectly experience different levels of romantic relationship quality during young adulthood. These findings illustrate the complex processes by which personality might affect quality of close social relationships in the short run, and the longer run. They suggest a developmental sequence in which individuals’ personality predicts proximal friendship quality during adolescence, and this in turn predicts distal romantic relationship quality during young adulthood.

Background  In visual psychophysics, precise display timing, particularly for brief stimulus presentations, is often required. The aim of this study was to systematically review the commonly applied methods for the computation of stimulus durations in psychophysical experiments and to contrast them with the true luminance signals of stimuli on computer displays.    Methodology/Principal Findings  In a first step, we systematically scanned the citation index Web of Science for studies with experiments with stimulus presentations for brief durations. Articles which appeared between 2003 and 2009 in three different journals were taken into account if they contained experiments with stimuli presented for less than 50 milliseconds. The 79 articles that matched these criteria were reviewed for their method of calculating stimulus durations. For those 75 studies where the method was either given or could be inferred, stimulus durations were calculated by the sum of frames (SOF) method. In a second step, we describe the luminance signal properties of the two monitor technologies which were used in the reviewed studies, namely cathode ray tube (CRT) and liquid crystal display (LCD) monitors. We show that SOF is inappropriate for brief stimulus presentations on both of these technologies. In extreme cases, SOF specifications and true stimulus durations are even unrelated. Furthermore, the luminance signals of the two monitor technologies are so fundamentally different that the duration of briefly presented stimuli cannot be calculated by a single method for both technologies. Statistics over stimulus durations given in the reviewed studies are discussed with respect to different duration calculation methods.    Conclusions/Significance  The SOF method for duration specification which was clearly dominating in the reviewed studies leads to serious misspecifications particularly for brief stimulus presentations. We strongly discourage its use for brief stimulus presentations on CRT and LCD monitors.   The author has no support or funding to report.   info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0012792.g006   Introduction   Motivation and Scope  Precise timing of visual stimuli can be a requirement for experiments in psychology. For instance, in rapid serial visual presentation paradigms, the onsets and offsets of the single stimuli need to be known and controlled for exactly to study perceptual phenomena like repetition blindness [1] or the attentional blink [2] . Another widely used technique is visual masking [3] in which the visibility of a briefly presented target stimulus is impaired by a masking stimulus presented in close spatiotemporal proximity. This paradigm, which is used in many experimental situations in psychophysics and visual neuroscience, requires brief stimulus presenations and precise timing not only for the stimuli themselves but also for the temporal distances between their presentations.  Many experimenters from these fields work with common computer hardware to display their stimuli and specify the presentation times according to common beliefs about how their display devices work. The present study shows that these widely applied methods of calculating presentation times bear severe misconceptions. Some of the specified times are even unrelated to the actual presentation durations.  This work is composed of two parts. First, a systematic review of experimental articles with brief presentation of visual stimuli investigates what temporal measures are commonly used for presentation durations. Second, these duration specification methods and their underlying assumptions are contrasted with the true temporal signals of the two most frequently used types of computer monitors, namely cathode ray tube (CRT) monitors and liquid crystal displays (LCD).  In the following paragraphs a concise introduction to common computer monitors and standard ways how to control them is given, including a brief review of the key literature.    Operating standard computer monitors  The graphics adapter of the computer addresses the visual image on the monitor as a discrete raster of pixels. As CRT monitors have been the dominating display technology over decades, many of the concepts how to control a monitor are taylored to the CRT technology. The main characteristics of this technology have been described already decades ago [4] , [5] : An electron beam inside the cathode ray tube scans the raster of pixels linewise from left to right, beginning with the uppermost line. When the beam has traversed the rightmost pixel in a line above the last line then it jumps to the first pixel one line below.  When the beam has passed the rightmost pixel in the last line it jumps back to the leftmost pixel in the first line. The period of time of this jump we call vertical blank . Fig. 1 outlines the raster scan concept. In the following, we call the time between two vertical blanks a frame . The duration of the frame is the reciprocal of the refresh rate of the monitor. The frequently used 60 Hz refresh rate, for instance, results in frames of 16.7 ms.  10.1371/journal.pone.0012792.g001 Figure 1   Schematic of the CRT raster scan.  The dashed arrows depict the course of the electron beam. The duration of the vertical blank is about 5% of the frame.   These CRT characteristics determine how CRT monitors can be controlled: The graphics adapter of the computer needs to be synchronized to the vertical blank of the monitor during which the buffered signal of the graphics card is sent. Therefore, the frame is the essential temporal unit to control stimulus durations.  LCD monitors do not have electron beams and the LCD technology would theoretically allow several other modes of display refresh. However, for historical reasons, LCD panels conform to the same raster scan mechanism as CRTs.    Temporal signals on CRT and LCD devices  Temporal signals of CRT monitors have been extensively studied in vision science [4] – [11] . The single dots of a CRT are covered with a substance called phosphor . Upon stimulation, the luminance of the phosphor rises rapidly and reaches its maximum almost instantaneously. After this, the energy decays, initially exponentially, later on converging to a power law course. There are different phosphors. On modern consumer CRT monitors, the most frequently used phosphor is P22. Fig. 2(a) shows the recording of the luminance course of a P22 phosphor after stimulation at time .  10.1371/journal.pone.0012792.g002 Figure 2   Comparison of CRT and LCD luminance transition signals.  The plots show the onset of a green stimulus on a black monitor at time . The CRT signal shown in ( a ) was measured from an Iiyama HM 204 DT monitor. The LCD signal shown in ( b ) was taken from a Dell 3007 WFP panel after backlight filtering by the division method [13] . Note the different scalings of the abscissas.   The time course of the phosphor decay is an essential characteristic of a CRT monitor. Because of the non–exponential course, specifications of decay constants, although convenient, are not appropriate for decays to low percentages of the maximum. Usually, decay times to the 10% level are specified. The persistence of the luminance signal depends on the phosphor type. For the frequently used P22 phosphor, Sherr [6] (p. 91) specifies decay times ranging from 1.5 ms to 6 ms. In our illustrative measurement ( Fig. 2(a) ), the luminance falls below the 10% level already after about 400 s. Note that a stimulus presented for frames is not displayed as a constant signal but rather as a succession of such pulses as shown in Fig. 2(a) .  Compared to the CRT literature, up to now there is substantially less literature about temporal signals of LCD monitors, and the use of LCD devices for medical and vision science purposes has been studied only by a few recent works [11] – [13] . In contrast to CRT signals, LCD signals are not pulsed but sample and hold displays, that is, the signal can be “switched on”, stays on a constant level, and can be “switched off” again. LCD panels do not have phosphors but are passively lit by a steady backlight. This backlight is not a constant signal but subject to periodic modulations the effects of which have been recently discussed [13] , [14] . LCD panels control their luminance by aligning the optical axis of the liquid crystal to allow transmission of the backlight through polarizers. Luminance changes on LCD monitors are determined by the speed of the liquid crystal alignment. The duration of an LCD luminance transition is called response time .  Fig. 2(b) shows the recording of a luminance transition from black to green on an LCD panel. The backlight modulations have been filtered by the division method [13] .  Note that the response times vary not only over different monitor models but are not even homogeneous with respect to different luminance levels on a single monitor [11] – [13] . Fig. 3 shows an example for this variability. The response times of a Dell 3007 WFP monitor have been measured for luminance transitions between 0% and 100% of the maximal luminance of the monitor in five steps. For this monitor, response times tend to be smallest for transitions to the target level 0 (black) and to the target level 100% (white). Note that transitions between two distinct levels need not be symmetric. For instance, the response time of the 25% 0% transition is only a fraction of the response time of the 0% 25% transition.  10.1371/journal.pone.0012792.g003 Figure 3   Response times variability over different luminance levels (Dell 3007 WFP LCD panel, green channel).  The bar plots show averaged response times over five measurements. Response times have been measured from five different initial levels (given as percentage of the maximal luminance of the monitor) to five target levels. All response times have been calculated by means of the division method with dynamical filtering [13] .      Results  The search of the electronic data base according to the criteria given in the Methods section produced a total of 402 citations. All citations were unique. Of these citations, 323 studies were discarded because after reviewing the full text it appeared that the experiments described in them did not make use of stimulus durations, onset asynchronies, or interstimulus intervals of less than 50 ms. Fig. 4 shows the respective flowchart according to the PRISMA guidelines [15] , [16] .  10.1371/journal.pone.0012792.g004 Figure 4   Flowchart for study selection.   The remaining 79 studies, which included a wide range of topics (e.g. attentional blink, metacontrast, apparent motion, flash lag effect, letter or word identification, temporal order judgment, face recognition, change and repetition blindness, or macula degeneration research), matched all the given criteria. Of these, only 17 (21.5%) described how they calculated their stimulus presentation durations. All of them summed up the frames during which the stimulus was presented. In the following we call this measurement sum of frames (SOF) method. For 58 further studies the SOF measure could be deduced from their given presentation duration values, either because their monitor refresh rate was specified or because all values were integer multiples of typical intervals between two monitor refreshes. For the remaining works no measurement method could be inferred from their given data.  36 (45.6%) articles mentioned the monitor model used. Two of them used an LCD panel, all the others used CRT monitors. 25 (31.6%) of the studies used stimulus duration or the interval between two stimuli as critical variables. Two studies verified their duration specifications by additional photodiode/oscilloscope measurements: One of them [17] verified the temporal interval between stimulus onsets and the other one [18] checked the monitor's refresh rate.  5 works computed statistics over presentation durations. Three of them [19] – [21] calculated means of durations, the other two works [22] , [23] fitted psychometric functions.  Fig. 5 shows the frequencies of the refresh rates (A) and of the minimal numbers of frames used for the shortest duration specification for all the reviewed studies where these parameters were either specified or could be inferred from the given stimulus durations. The figure illustrates that more than half of the studies (50.6%) worked with minimal presentation times as short as one single frame. Furthermore, the most frequently used refresh rate is as low as 60 Hz which allows a temporal resolution of only 16.7 ms.  10.1371/journal.pone.0012792.g005 Figure 5   Display timing characteristics in the literature review studies.

Discussion   Possible selection bias  The restriction to three journals and two search terms might be criticized with respect to a possible selection bias of the reviewed studies. However, the selected journals are key journals in the fields of experimental psychology ( Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance and Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition ) and vision science ( Vision Research ).  In addition, the choice of two frequently used experimental techniques as search terms instead of searching for special perceptual phenomena/illusions aims to minimize the selection bias with respect to research topics. Indeed, the selected studies contain a wide range of psychological subjects, as noted in the Results section.    The SOF method and its misconceptions  All stimulus duration specifications for which a specification method could be found out were given according to the SOF measure. This finding is surprising for the at least 34 studies which used CRT monitors since for the latter devices the SOF method has been criticized already more than a decade ago [9] . The signal plot in Fig. 2(a) illustrates why this method is not suitable for CRT monitors: The short pulse of the CRT luminance signal occurs at the very beginning of the frame. After this pulse, the luminance is nearly zero up to the start of the subsequent frame. The SOF method, however, implicitly assumes a rectangular signal which starts at the beginning of the onset frame of the stimulus and lasts until the end of the offset frame.  Fig. 6 compares the SOF assumptions with true CRT and LCD luminance signals and the related implications for a hypothetical psychological experiment with brief stimulus presentation. We assume the classical disk–ring paradigm which was introduced already decades ago [24] . Variations of this paradigm were used in several of the studies from the literature review, both for CRT monitors [25] and for LCD monitors [26] .  10.1371/journal.pone.0012792.g006 Figure 6   Stimulus succession on CRT vs. LCD monitors.  Schematic of the luminance course of a disk stimulus presented for one frame followed by a surrounding ring stimulus. The signals of the disk stimulus are shown in blue, those of the ring stimulus in red. The top row outlines the signal assumptions according to the SOF method. The two underneath rows sketch the true signal shapes on LCD and for CRT monitors, respectively.   In our hypothetical experiment, a disk stimulus is presented for one frame. In the next frame, a surrounding ring is presented, and our hypothetical experimenter specifies both the stimulus duration and the interstimulus interval (ISI) between disk and ring according to the SOF method. As for the ISI, the SOF method assumes temporal adjacency, that is the onset of the ring occurs at the same time as the offset of the disk. The experimenter would therefore state an ISI of zero and a duration of the disk of one frame, as outlined in the top row of Fig. 6 . If we assume the refresh rate which was most frequently used in the reviewed studies, namely 60 Hz (see Fig. 5A ), the experimenter would specify a stimulus duration of 16.7 ms.  Let us compare these assumptions with the signal shapes on a CRT monitor, as sketched in the bottom row of Fig. 6 . The luminance signal of the disk stimulus is a pulse determined by the almost instantaneous phosphor activation at frame start and by the following phosphor decay to zero. Obviously, it is unclear how to specify the true stimulus duration. One might integrate over the pulse and approximate a rectangular signal of the equivalent luminance or one might define the offset at the point in time when the luminance has decayed to 10% of its maximum, or define a time from the beginning of the frame until the luminance has decayed to nearly zero, as Bridgeman [9] suggested. In Fig. 6 we do the latter. In our sketch, ms, which is in the time range of typical CRT phosphors [6] . The true disk duration would be ms now instead of 16.7 ms, that is, the SOF method would considerably overestimate the duration. Note that there are monitors with much lower phosphor decay times (see, for instance, Fig. 2(a) ). In addition, the assumption of temporal adjacency is violated, as the true ISI is 14 ms and hence substantially greater than zero.  The LCD signal as sketched in the figure seems to be closer to the SOF assumption. However, this is only true if two conditions are met. First, the response times must be considerably shorter than one frame. This condition is often violated. It can take several frames until the signal reaches its target level [11] . Second, the rising and falling response signals must be symmetric. This need not be the case as well, as discussed above and illustrated in Fig. 3 . In this case, the SOF measure might be improved by subtracting the rise time and adding the fall time if the first condition is met. The figure outlines as well that the ISI  =  0 assumption of the SOF measure is violated for LCD panels because the rising signal of the ring and the falling signal of the disk partially overlap, and there might be unexpected display effects particularly if the rising and the falling signals are not symmetric.  In addition, Fig. 3 illustrates that CRT and LCD signals are so different that it is not appropriate to use one and the same method to specify durations of brief stimuli.  Finally, it has to be noted that for CRT monitors the SOF method is suitable if distances between stimuli are not given in terms of ISI but in terms of stimulus onset asynchronies (SOA) instead. This holds for LCD monitors as well as long as the rising transition signals of the two stimuli are similar enough.    Statistics over stimulus durations  For most of the literature review studies the wrong assumptions about stimulus durations probably do not have any impact on the experimental findings and conclusions. However, in studies where statistics are calculated over stimulus durations or ISIs, alternative timing specification methods may easily affect the experimental results after the statistical data analysis.  As mentioned above, such statistical analyses have been performed by five studies [19] – [23] . In the following, let us compare the durations specified by the authors with respective durations calculated according to the more accurate Bridgeman model which is described in detail in the next section.  Three works [19] – [21] calculated basic statistics like means and corresponding standard deviations. As is almost one frame less than , means are smaller than means, and for brief durations the difference is substantial. Moreover, times are always multiples of one frame, but the Bridgeman model destroys this multiplicity. This can become relevant for stimulus duration comparisons, as the following example demonstrates.  Lleras and Moore [19] compared average presentation durations for a certain performance level under two conditions. Consistent with their hypothesis, in one of the conditions presentation duration was longer. They state the durations for the two conditions with 20.8 ms resp. 28.3 ms and report an increase of 39%. Their frame rate was 60 Hz, and their calculations of the averages were the results of different distributions of presentations for one and two frames (SOF measure: 16.7 ms resp. 33.4 ms) over 60 presentations in each condition. If we apply , the 16.7 ms turn into phosphor decay (only a few milliseconds) and the 33.4 ms into ms. Because of the violated proportionality, the increase will be much higher than their stated 39%.  In this case, applying the Bridgeman model gives even more evidence for their hypothesis, since an increase was predicted, but the “true” increase was even stronger than the assumed one. However, in cases where an increase according to the SOF measure would be so small that it is regarded to be irrelevant, the Bridgeman model could easily rise the difference above a possible significance level.  The fit of psychometric functions to stimulus durations, as practiced by some of the reviewed studies, requires careful considerations regarding the duration specification method as well, particularly in cases of parametric models which do not include vertical shifts of the data. Note that is has recently been shown for logistic functions that the loglikelihood difference of two conditions can even change its sign if durations are calculated according to the Bridgeman model [11] . That means, experimenters might assume opposite experimental results after their data analyses.  To sum up, different duration specification models can have considerable influences on statistical data analyses.    Alternatives to the SOF method  For CRT monitors, alternatives to the SOF method have been discussed in the literature. Robson [8] suggests directed luminance changes to realize “perceptual stimulus durations” which differ from physical durations calculated according to SOF. For instance, the author reports that halving the luminance in the last frame of a stimulus that extends over of frames can result in a retinal response the decay of which occurs halfway between the decay of the signal of and full luminance screens. This way, the experimenter can generate “perceptual” durations which are not multiples of frames.  While this is an interesting approach which may overcome the discretization limitations of stimulus durations, it requires reliable models of the visual system and goes far beyond the target of many experimenters who want to describe the physical durations of their stimuli.  Bridgeman [9] favors this type of description of the physical duration and suggests an approach which we will call Bridgeman model in the following. The Bridgeman model calculates the stimulus duration on a CRT monitor by SOF minus one frame plus the phosphor decay time. For stimulus presentations over many frames, the Bridgeman model converges to SOF. For brief durations, however, there are substantial deviations. Note that for single frame presentations the stimulus duration according to the Bridgeman model is even unrelated to the duration according to SOF , and the majority of the studies from the literature review used minimal presentation durations of one frame (see Fig. 5(b) ).  While the Bridgeman model considers the specific luminance signal shape of CRT monitors, it neglects possible effects of the duty cycle (that is the ratio of the ON–period to the desired stimulus duration). For instance, for a two–frame CRT stimulus with a refresh rate of 60 Hz and a phosphor decay of 3.3 ms it calculates a stimulus duration of 20 ms although the ON–period of the signal was only ms ms. Apart from that, it does not consider the special signal shape. For single frame presentations, the signal is a decaying pulse. The Bridgeman model defines the stimulus duration by the period during which the signal is different from zero and neglects the substantial luminance changes during this period.  In addition, as Bridgeman points out himself [9] , the Bridgeman model neglects phase delays between the top and the bottom of the display. These delays are relevant particularly for single frame presentations. As outlined in Fig. 1 , it takes almost one frame to build up the display from the topmost line to the last line. A stimulus presented at the bottom of the screen in frame is temporally close to a stimulus presented at the top of the screen in frame .  For brief stimulus presentations it might be more useful to avoid the specification of durations in milliseconds. Instead, experimenters should report the durations by the number of frames only and give as many details as possible about the display device and its characteristics, like phosphor decay for CRTs or response times for LCDs.    Conclusion  This systematic review shows that the SOF method is the clearly dominating measure to specify the durations of stimuli even for brief presentations. Furthermore, it is demonstrated why this method is inadequate for the two major display technologies, namely CRT and LCD, and that the luminance signals of these two technologies are fundamentally different. The use of the SOF method is strongly discouraged for brief stimulus presentations. Instead, experimenters should always specify the number of presentation frames, the monitor model and technology, the refresh rate, and ideally also details about the luminance signal shape (phosphor decay/liquid crystal response).     Methods   Literature review  The citation index Web of Science (Thomson Reuters) was systematically scanned for works with brief presentations of visual stimuli. For literature reviews, the choice of an appropriate search term is essential. The search term “brief presentation” did not prove useful, and searching for special perceptual phenomena like “attentional blink” might result in biased samples of works. Therefore, we decided our search terms to be two widespread techniques which are used to investigate a wide range of perceptual phenomena and which frequently require brief stimulus presentations. Namely, we chose articles which contained at least one of the two terms “rapid serial visual presentation” or “masking” either in title, abstract, or keywords.  All articles which met the search term criteria and appeared between 2003 and 2009 in one of the three journals Vision Research , Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance , and Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition were chosen if they contained experiments with stimuli presented for less than 50 ms or temporal distances between stimuli (SOA or ISI) of less than 50 ms on computer controlled displays. The latter criterion was checked for by reviewing the full text of all the studies obtained by the data base search.  This review was performed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta–Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines [15] , [16] .    Signal measurements  In order to illustrate our analysis of signal shapes, we provide examples of signal and response time measurements from two monitors, namely the Dell 3007 WFP LCD monitor (Dell Inc., Round Rock, Texas, USA) and the Iiyama HM204DT CRT monitor (Iiyama Corporation, Asakusa-Bashi Taito-Ku, Tokyo, Japan). The Iiyama signal in Fig. 2(a) has been measured by a Tektronix TDS410A oscilloscope, the Dell signal in Fig. 2(b) by an optical transient recorder OTR–3 (Display Metrology & Systems GmbH & Co. KG, Karlsruhe, Germany, http://display-messtechnik.de/typo3/fileadmin/template/main/docs/OTR3-6.pdf ).  In order to determine response times shown in Fig. 3 , the LCD backlight modulation has been removed according to the division method with dynamical filtering [13] . The bar plots in Fig. 3 show response time averages over five independent measurements for each transition.

The ability to regulate emotions is a critical component of healthy emotional functioning. Therefore, it is important to determine factors that contribute to the efficacy of emotion regulation. The present article examined whether the ability to update emotional information in working memory is a predictor of the efficacy of rumination and reappraisal on affective experience both at the trait level (Study 1) and in daily life (Study 2). In both studies, results revealed that the relationship between use of reappraisal and high arousal negative emotions was moderated by updating ability. Specifically, use of reappraisal was associated with decreased high arousal negative emotions for participants with high updating ability, while no significant relationship was found for those with low updating ability. In addition, both studies also revealed that the relationship between rumination and high arousal negative emotions was moderated by updating ability. In general, use of rumination was associated with elevated high arousal negative emotions. However, this relationship was blunted for participants with high updating ability. That is, use of rumination was associated with less elevated high arousal negative emotions for participants with high updating ability. These results identify the ability to update emotional information in working memory as a crucial process modulating the efficacy of emotion regulation efforts.

Although the past decade has seen an upsurge of research into the use and consequences of emotion regulation, much less is known about the factors that make people regulate their emotions effectively. In other words, what determines the outcome of regulating one’s emotions?  One promising avenue lies in executive functions (see also [1] ). Indeed, executive functions or cognitive control are considered to play a central role in emotion regulation [1] – [3] . There is a growing number of empirical studies showing that individual differences in cognitive control are related to the use of various emotion regulation strategies. For instance, the ability to control negative information in working memory (WM) has been associated with the habitual use of both rumination (e.g., [4] – [5] ) and reappraisal (e.g., [6] ).  Although studies like these give invaluable insight into the cognitive underpinnings underlying the use of specific emotion regulation strategies, it is at least equally important to understand whether these cognitive abilities determine the efficacy of emotion regulation strategies for changing one’s emotions [1] . That is, in addition to examining whether deficits in controlling negative material in WM would increase or decrease the use of certain emotion regulation strategies (e.g., rumination), it should also be examined to what extent and how such deficits modulate the effect of such emotion regulation strategies on emotional experience [7] . From this perspective, emotion regulation is viewed as a higher cognitive activity that necessitates the support of basic cognitive processes to determine its efficacy.  In the present article, two studies are presented that addressed whether individual differences in controlling emotional information in WM indeed relate to the efficacy of emotion regulation strategies on emotional experience. More precisely, using trait questionnaires (Study 1) and experience sampling methodology (Study 2), we examined whether the ability to update emotional information in WM moderates the efficacy of rumination and reappraisal on the experience of positive and negative emotions.   Updating and Emotion Regulation  In trying to understand the role of cognitive processes in emotion regulation, we focus on (depressive) rumination and reappraisal. Whereas (depressive) rumination is defined as repetitively thinking about negative feelings, their possible causes, meanings and consequences [8] , reappraisal is defined as viewing emotional events from a different perspective so as to lessen their emotional impact [9] . Both strategies are implemented cognitively and involve sustained attention on emotional experience [10] , making them prime candidates to be affected by the cognitive processes discussed above. Yet, they are also clearly distinct. Habitual use of rumination is related to enhanced negative thinking, impaired problem solving, exacerbated and prolonged distress, and makes one more vulnerable to the development of psychopathology (e.g., depression) [8] , while habitual use of reappraisal is generally associated with more desirable outcomes on average such as reduced negative emotions, increased positive emotions, better interpersonal functioning and well-being [9] . As such, the focus on these two strategies allows testing of predictions on the role of updating on both adaptive and maladaptive forms of emotion regulation on emotional experience.  Here, we argue that the efficacy of such emotion regulation actions critically relies on the extent to which the contents in WM are able to change to accommodate new information as it becomes available. For instance, when a negative event is experienced (e.g., failing an exam), negative thoughts are activated in WM (e.g., I’m not good enough), and negative emotions are experienced (e.g., sad). In order to reduce the experience of negative emotions, there is a need to modify or update these negative thoughts with newer information that is either more neutral or positive (e.g., I failed, but that does not determine my success or failure as a student). Updating, which refers to the ability to change the contents of WM to accommodate new information [11] , is the executive function that is involved in such cognitive activity.   Updating and Reappraisal  The importance of being able to update information in WM is crucial to effective reappraisal. Since reappraisal involves changing one’s current perspective of an emotion-eliciting event, updating is necessary in order to form another perspective by replacing the current perspective with a newer and more relevant one. In other words, updating is necessary in order to effectively reappraise.  To our knowledge, only one study has tested this hypothesis. In a study by Schmeichel, Volokhov and Demaree [12] , they showed that the efficacy of reappraisal was moderated by updating (as measured by a non-emotional n-back task). That is, people with high (vs. low) updating ability were more successful at reappraising a disgusting film in the lab as non-emotional, as evidenced by their experience and expression of less disgust in response to the film.  We therefore hypothesize that updating will moderate the relationship between reappraisal and emotional experience, such that people with a high (vs. low) updating ability will experience less negative and more positive emotions when reappraising.   Updating and Rumination  (Depressive) rumination involves the process of thinking repetitively about one’s feelings and problems [8] . This suggests that when ruminating, people continuously dwell on (negative) information that is already present in WM [13] , resulting in a heightened experience of negative affect [14] – [15] .  We propose that updating is one executive process that could help break the ruminative process by reducing the elaboration of negative material in WM [13] . Indeed, since rumination is about recycling thoughts in WM, then having the ability to accommodate new information in WM (through updating) would allow newer and possibly mood-incongruent thoughts to feed into the ruminative process. This would aid in minimizing the maladaptive consequences of rumination (i.e., experiencing less elevated negative and less decreased positive emotions). Conversely, the inability to update information in WM would lead to rumination having a continuous detrimental impact on affective experience.  Whereas there is evidence that updating and rumination are related [16] , no study has examined whether updating also modulates the relationship between rumination and emotional experience. We hypothesize that updating will moderate the relationship between rumination and emotional experience, such that people with a high (vs. low) updating ability will experience less elevated negative and less decreased positive emotions when ruminating.   The Present Study  As far as we know, the study done by Schmeichel and colleagues [12] using the n -back is the only empirical evidence so far that identifies updating as a moderator of the efficacy of reappraisal. Therefore, as a first goal, we aimed to provide empirical replication for the role of updating on the efficacy of emotion regulation by using an emotional variant of the n -back as a measure of updating. The underlying rationale is that a task that specifically involves valenced emotional information in working memory would be particularly relevant for picking up the processes operating during emotion regulation. Second, the relationship between updating and efficacy of reappraisal has only been examined using laboratory studies [12] . While it is definitely important to study people’s emotional responses to standardized stimuli in the lab, it is nevertheless crucial to replicate lab findings in the context of the complexities encountered in daily life [17] . After all, it is there that psychological phenomena eventually play out and affect people’s well-being. Lastly, we wanted to examine whether the moderating effect of updating ability would extend to the case rumination. That is, if updating is indeed an important determinant of effective reappraisal, we project that this would also aid in curbing or attenuating the deleterious effect of rumination on emotional experience.  In sum, with the present research, we sought to examine whether updating of emotional information in WM (as measured by an emotional n -back task [18] ) would be associated with the efficacy of rumination and reappraisal on emotional experience both at the trait level (Study 1) and in daily life (Study 2). We hypothesized that updating of emotional information in WM would moderate the efficacy of both reappraisal and rumination on emotional experience. That is, we expected that people who are better at updating emotional information would experience more decreased negative affect and more elevated positive affect when reappraising; and less elevated negative affect and less decreased positive affect when ruminating.   Study 1: Trait Level  Study 1 tested the hypothesis that at the trait level, updating of emotional information would moderate the relationship between reappraisal and rumination, on the one hand, and positive and negative emotions, on the other hand. Participants completed an emotional n -back task and responded to questionnaires regarding their feelings during the past week, and their habitual use of reappraisal and rumination, among others.   Ethics Statement  The study was conducted in December 2011 as part of a large collective research program organized and approved by the Faculty of Psychology and Educational Sciences, KU Leuven, Belgium. All first year psychology students are invited to participate in this research in exchange for course credits. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants at the start of the program.  In accordance with the “Law of 7 May 2004 concerning experiments on the human person,” ( https://ppw.kuleuven.be/intern/ethischecommissie/wet ) an authorization is necessary from the Medical Ethics Committee of the University Hospitals Leuven, Faculty of Medicine for experiments that “touches the person in their essence.” These experiments mean studies which include physical changes such as the need to breathe faster, painful stimuli, using deception and other (taken from https://ppw.kuleuven.be/intern/ethischecommissie/index and translated to English).  The present study used questionnaires and a computer task that fall within these conditions, and therefore did not necessitate approval from the ethics committee. However, as of June 2012, the University has decided that all studies within the collective research program would require ethical approval. Since then, we have applied for and have been granted ethical approval for studies using similar participants and the same computer task and questionnaires.   Participants  Two hundred twenty-five first year psychology students participated in this study. Four participants did not have complete data and were eliminated from the study, leaving a sample of 221 (184 women; M age  = 18.47, SD age  = 1.22). Participants earned partial course credit for their participation in the study.   Procedure  The study was administered in groups of 25, with each session lasting for a maximum of 30 minutes. All participants were first required to respond to the emotional n- back task, which was administered on a desktop computer. After completing the computer task, they responded to trait questionnaires using paper and pencil.   Measures   Emotional n-back  Participants completed the emotional n -back task as a measure of updating emotional information [18] . This task was adapted from Levens and Gotlib [13] , but words instead of faces were used as stimuli. A total of 47 positive and 49 negative words were selected from the Affective Norms of English Words list [19] and translated into Dutch. Words were identified as negative and positive if their valence ratings ranged from 1–4 and 6–9, respectively, and they were also matched in word length, number of syllables and arousal levels (see Table 1 ). The task consisted of 24 practice trials (not scored) and 96 actual trials separated into four blocks of 24 trials. The first two trials of every block were not scored, leaving a total of 88 relevant trials for analysis. In each trial, participants viewed a single affective word presented centrally for 500ms followed by a 2500ms intertrial interval. Participants were instructed to indicate whether the valence of the current word (i.e., newer, incoming stimulus) had the same (match) or different (non-match) valence as the word two trials back by pressing the ‘1’ or ‘2’ key, respectively. There were 44 match trials (22 trials were positive-valenced stimuli, i.e., the current stimulus and the stimulus two trials back were both positive) and 44 non-match trials (21 trials were positive-valenced stimuli; i.e., the current stimulus was positive, but the stimulus two trials back was negative). To measure participants’ ability to update emotional information, we calculated the mean accuracy scores across all trials. “No responses” or omissions were counted as errors.  10.1371/journal.pone.0069071.t001 Table 1  Descriptives of the Emotional n -back word list.

In the classical n -back, participants had to match the current stimulus with the stimulus n trials before. The emotional 2 -back that Levens and Gotlib [13] created is more similar to the classical n -back, in which participants had to simply match emotional faces. In this variant of the emotional n -back, there was an added complexity to the task: Participants had to first identify the valence of the new word before matching its valence with the word 2 trials back. This way, we ensure that participants were processing the emotional stimulus presented, and not just its perceptual features.  In addition, studies using response time (RT) scores have mean accuracy scores above 80% (e.g., [12] – [13] ), making RT scores a reliable measure of ability. However, in the current task, participants tend to have lower mean accuracy scores (see Tables 2 and 3 ), making us hesitant to rely on RT scores as a measure of ability. However, for completeness, we also report RT results. For the RT scores, data preparation procedure can be found in [18] , with the exception that the data used was the overall emotional n -back score for the current article, while data from specific valence conditions was used for the former article.  10.1371/journal.pone.0069071.t002 Table 2  Descriptive Statistics and Relationships of Different Variables in Study 1.

As the multilevel estimates for the Level 1 variables are not symmetrical, the coefficients before the diagonal represent the coefficients obtained, in which the preceding variable was entered as the predictor and the succeeding variable as the outcome (e.g., reappraisal → rumination), while the coefficients after the diagonal represent the estimates, in which the succeeding variable was the predictor and the preceding variable was the outcome (e.g., rumination → reappraisal). The estimates provided for the relationship between a trait and daily variable (e.g., emotional n-back and reappraisal) are unstandardized coefficients with the daily variable as the Level 1 outcome and the trait variable as a Level 2 predictor. Emotional n -back performance is measured using accuracy scores. Negative interference is measured using RTs, ER Mean = average emotion regulation use. Significant correlations are indicated in bold ( p <.05; 2-tailed).  Positive and negative affectivity  To measure positive (PA) and negative affectivity (NA), participants responded to the twenty-item Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS; [20] ). Participants rated how much they experienced each of the 10 positive and 10 negative feelings in the past week using a scale from 1 ( very slightly or not at all ) to 5 ( extremely ) in the past week. PA and NA were calculated as the average score of the 10 positive and 10 negative feeling items, respectively.   Reappraisal  Participants completed the Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (ERQ; [9] ). Participants rated from a scale of 1 ( strongly disagree ) to 7 ( strongly agree ) how much they typically use suppression (four items) and reappraisal (six items). Use of reappraisal was calculated as the average of the six reappraisal items in the questionnaire.   Rumination  Participants completed the 22-item Ruminative Response Style Questionnaire (RRS; [21] ; Dutch version: [22] ). They rated from a scale of 1 ( almost never ) to 4 ( almost always ) how often they ruminate when they are feeling sad or depressed. Habitual use of rumination was calculated as the average of all items in the questionnaire.   Statistical Model  We ran a series of regression models to test whether the ability to update emotional information would moderate the relationship between reappraisal and rumination on one hand, and PA and NA, on the other hand. In the model, PA and NA were entered as dependent variables separately with overall emotional n -back and reappraisal scores (which were standardized), and their interaction as predictors. We also ran similar analyses, but with rumination (instead of reappraisal) as a predictor.   Results   Preliminary Analyses  Descriptive statistics and intercorrelations are presented in Table 2 . PA and NA were negatively correlated. Trait rumination was positively correlated with NA, and negatively correlated with PA. Trait reappraisal was positively correlated with PA, but did not have a significant relationship with NA. Moreover, we did not find a significant correlation between performance on the emotional n -back (accuracy scores) and any of the trait questionnaire measures.  There was also a positive correlation between the RT and the accuracy scores of the emotional n -back ( r  = .16, p  = .02), implying a speed accuracy trade off. None of the trait measures correlated significantly with the RT scores of the emotional n- back (reappraisal: r  = .03, p  = .68; rumination: r  = −.06, p  = .39; PA: r  = −.03, p  = .63; NA: r  = −.01, p  = .83).   Reappraisal and NA  No significant main effects between reappraisal and NA ( β  = −.08, SE  = .04, p  = .07), and performance on the emotional n -back and NA ( β  = −.01, SE  = .04, p  = .85) were found. However, there was a significant interaction between reappraisal and performance on the emotional n- back ( β  = −.09, SE  = .04, p  = .02).  We applied the simple slope analysis proposed by Preacher, Curran, and Bauer [23] to disentangle the interaction effect. Results revealed that participants with high updating ability (i.e., 1 SD above the mean) had a significant negative relationship between reappraisal and NA ( β  = −.17, SE  = .07, p  = .01). That is, for participants with high updating ability, habitually using reappraisal as an emotion regulation strategy was related to lower NA. However, for participants with low updating ability (i.e., 1 SD below the mean), the relationship between reappraisal and NA was non-significant ( β  = .02, SE  = .06, p  = .77). That is, the use of reappraisal was not associated with NA for participants with low updating ability. Figure 1 (left panel) illustrates this interaction effect.  10.1371/journal.pone.0069071.g001 Figure 1  Illustration of the moderating effect of overall updating ability (as measured by the emotional n -back) on the relationship between reappraisal (left panel) and rumination (right panel) on NA at the trait level.  Dashed and straight lines represent participants with low (-1 SD ) and high (+1 SD ) n -back scores, respectively. Low and high reappraisal scores are -1 SD and +1 SD from the overall mean, respectively. Low and high rumination scores were coded similarly.   For RT scores of the emotional n -back, no significant main effects between reappraisal and NA ( β  = −.07, SE  = .04, p  = .12), between emotional n -back and NA ( β  = −.01, SE  = .04, p  = .84) or interaction ( β  = −.04, SE  = .04, p  = .30) were found.   Reappraisal and PA  There was a significant main effect between reappraisal and PA ( β  = .19, SE  = .05, p <.01) but not between reappraisal and the emotional n -back ( β  = −.05, SE  = .05, p  = .25). That is, participants who habitually used reappraisal as an emotion regulation strategy also experienced higher PA. No significant interaction was found ( β  = .04, SE  = .04, p  = .38).  For RT scores, there was a significant main effect of reappraisal on PA ( β  = .19, SE  = .05, p <.01), but not between emotional n- back and PA ( β  = −.03, SE  = .05, p  = .56). No significant interactions were also found ( β  = .06, SE  = .04, p  = .17).   Rumination and NA  There was a significant main effect of rumination on NA ( β  = .26, SE  = .04, p <.01), but not for the emotional n -back on NA ( β  = −.02, SE  = .04, p  = .59). However, a significant interaction between rumination and the emotional n- back task was found ( β  = −.11, SE  = .04, p <.01).  Simple slope analysis [23] revealed that participants with high updating ability had a smaller positive slope ( β  = .14, SE  = .05, p <.01) compared to those with low updating ability ( β  = .37, SE  = .05, p <.01 ). This implies that although the habitual use of rumination implied higher NA scores, updating ability mitigated this effect. Indeed, participants with high (vs. low) updating ability and who habitually used rumination as an emotion regulation strategy reported less elevated NA. Figure 1 (right panel) illustrates this interaction effect.  For RT scores, there was a significant main effect of rumination on NA ( β  = .25, SE  = .04, p <.01), and the interaction between rumination and the RT scores of the emotional n -back was marginally significant ( β  = −.07, SE  = .04, p  = .08). Main effect between emotional n -back and NA was non-significant ( β  = .00, SE  = .04, p  = .97).   Rumination and PA  There was a significant main effect of rumination on PA ( β  = −.15, SE  = .05, p <.01), but not of the emotional n -back on PA ( β  = −.03, SE  = .05, p  = .56). That is, participants who habitually ruminated experienced a lower PA. No significant interaction was found ( β  = −.02, SE  = .04, p  = .71).  For RT scores, there was a significant main effect of rumination on PA ( β  = −.15, SE  = .05, p <.01), but not between the emotional n -back and PA ( β  = −.03, SE  = .05, p  = .50). The interaction between rumination and emotional n -back was also non-significant ( β  = .00, SE  = .05, p  = .99).   Updating ability while controlling for effort or compliance  To discount the possibility that updating ability (as measured by accuracy scores) may be partly confounded by effort or compliance in doing the task, we also performed analyses only with participants who responded to at least 75% of the relevant trials (i.e., 66 out of 88 trials; n  = 188). Results remained largely similar as presented above (with the exception that the interaction between reappraisal and emotional n-back became non-significant ( β  = −.06, SE  = .04, p  = .16). However, when applying the simple slope analysis, we found that participants with a high updating ability (1 SD above the mean) still had a significant negative slope ( β  = −.16, SE  = .07, p  = .02), while the slope for participants with a low overall n-back (1 SD below the mean) remained non-significant ( β  = −.04, SE  = .06, p  = .47).   Discussion  The results of Study 1 showed that updating of emotional information was associated with the efficacy of reappraisal, supporting the findings of Schmeichel and colleagues [12] . Specifically, we found that updating moderated the relationship between reappraisal and NA, but not with PA. That is, the habitual use of reappraisal was associated with more decreased NA among participants with high, but not with low updating ability. Results also showed that updating moderated the relationship between rumination and NA, but not with PA. That is, the habitual use of rumination was associated with less elevated NA among participants with high (vs. low) updating ability.  Although the results of Study 1 give us important insight regarding the role of updating in regulating negative (and not of positive) emotions, it is still limited in three important ways: First, the use of trait questionnaires does not directly measure the use of emotion regulation strategies and its association with the intensity of emotions as they are experienced in everyday life. Second, it remains unclear whether the results are specific to updating ability, or are due to a shared ability with other executive processes that also moderate this relationship [24] . For correct conclusions to be drawn, it is important to exactly pinpoint the processes involved in our findings. Third, the range of emotions may be limited. The measure used to assess positive and negative emotions in this study (i.e., PANAS) only measures high arousal positive and negative emotions [25] , which prevents us from making any conclusion about their low arousal counterparts.   Study 2: Daily Life  Study 2 had three primary objectives. First, we aimed to examine whether the moderating effect of updating on the relationship between reappraisal and rumination on one hand, and affective experience on the other hand, would also occur in everyday life. In a previous study [7] , we found that inhibition (specifically of negative information), an executive process that is related to updating [24] , played a moderating role on the relationship between emotion regulation and emotional experience in everyday life. In this study, we wanted to examine whether updating would also moderate this relationship.  If updating would also moderate the relationship between rumination and reappraisal and affective experience, then it also becomes important to disentangle whether it is the shared relationship between updating and inhibition of negative information, or specific updating process that would moderate this relationship. To achieve this, we re-analyzed our experience sampling data set [7] , [18] , in which participants reported their emotions and their use of reappraisal and rumination 10 times a day, among others, over the course of one week, but this time we used the emotional n -back as the moderating variable. We also performed analyses with both inhibition (specifically of negative information as reported in [7] ) and updating entered into the model to evaluate their unique contribution.  Finally, we wanted to explore whether the findings from Study 1 also apply to low arousal emotions. To test this hypothesis, we studied both high and low arousal positive and negative emotional states by including both high (happy) and low arousal positive items (relaxed); and both high (anger/anxiety) and low arousal negative items (sadness/dysphoria).   Ethics statement  The study was conducted between February 2011 and May 2011. Ethical approval was requested since part of the study involved the use of physiological measures. This study was approved by the local ethics committee of the Faculty of Psychology and Educational Sciences, KU Leuven, Belgium. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants.   Participants  Out of 439 first year undergraduates from University of Leuven who completed the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D; [26] ), 100 participants, representing a wide, balanced, and uniform range of depression scores (range = 0–50, M  = 19.27, SD  = 12.53), were selected to take part in an experience sampling study. One participant withdrew early and four participants were excluded from data analyses (due to equipment malfunction, n  = 3, or poor compliance, n  = 1) leaving a final sample of 95 participants.   Procedure  Participants received a Tungsten E2 palmtop computer along with instructions for general use and how to respond to the questions at each beep. For one week, participants carried the palmtop computer as they went about their daily activities. Palmtops were individually programmed (using ESP 4; [27] ) to beep 10 times a day (during a 12-hour period) for seven consecutive days. On each day, the 12-hour sampling period was divided into 10 equal time blocks and one beep was programmed to occur randomly within each block. Items were presented in random order at each beep. Overall, participants responded to 91.5% ( SD  = 6.2) of the programmed beeps, demonstrating very good compliance.  Within the week of the experience sampling study, participants were required to attend a laboratory session to do additional cognitive tasks (i.e., emotional flanker [28] , affective interference resolution task [7] , emotional stroop-switching task [29] and the emotional n -back [18] , which were administered in individual cubicles.  Since our previous findings have shown that the affective interference resolution task (specifically for negative stimuli) also moderated the regulation of emotional experience [7] , we added this inhibition measure to our statistical models as a control variable. This will help ascertain that it is updating of emotional information, and not the shared relationship between inhibition of negative stimuli and updating that would explain the present findings. Descriptive statistics are presented in Table 3 .   Measures   Repeated assessment of emotions  At each sampling moment, participants reported how much they were feeling a number of specific emotions. Using a continuous slider scale that ranged from 1 ( not at all ) to 100 ( very much ), participants recorded their current levels of anger, sadness, dysphoria, anxiety, happiness and relaxation. A composite score for high and low arousal negative emotions was created by taking the mean score of the anger/anxiety and sadness/dysphoria items, respectively for each beep. High and low arousal positive emotions were taken from the items happiness and relaxation, respectively.   Repeated assessment of rumination and reappraisal  At each sampling moment, participants were asked to report on their use of a number of emotion regulation strategies. Of interest to the current study, an item on reappraisal (“Have you viewed the cause of your feelings from a different perspective since the last beep?”) and an item on rumination (“Have you ruminated since the last beep?”) were assessed. We have to note that the Dutch word used for “ruminated” was piekeren . “Piekeren” is the term that is used in everyday language to refer to rumination (and worrying). Piekeren , thus, broadly refers to recurrent negative thinking.  Participants also responded to items probing about other emotion regulation strategies (i.e., suppression, reflection, social sharing and distraction). Participants responded to these questions using a continuous slider that ranged from 1 ( not at all) to 100 ( very much ). We also calculated a composite score for overall use of emotion regulation (ER mean) by taking the mean score of all emotion regulation items for each participant at each beep to represent how much participants tried to regulate their feelings in general at each moment (see also [7] ).   Emotional n-back  Detailed description of the emotional n- back can be found in Study 1. Mean accuracy score was used as the main index of participant’s ability to update emotional information. Descriptive statistics are presented in Table 3 .   Affective interference resolution task  We used the affective interference resolution task as a measure of inhibition. This task allows us to measure the level of interference from previously relevant (but is now irrelevant) emotional information in working memory. High levels of interference indicate difficulties inhibiting previously relevant information from accessing working memory. Detailed description of the task can be found in [7] .  The task was composed of one practice block comprising eight trials (not scored) and 144 actual trials separated into eight blocks. Each trial began with a target set of four words presented around a fixation cross on the center of the screen for 1200ms, which was then followed by a delay of 3000ms, where only the fixation cross was presented. The fixation cross was then replaced by a probe word for 1500ms. Participants had to respond as quickly and accurately as possible whether or not the probe word was part of the current target set. Using the computer keyboard, participants pressed “1” if the answer was “Yes” and “2” if the answer was “No.”  Each target set contained two words that had been presented in the previous target set and two words that had not appeared in each of the two previous target sets. In addition, there was always at least one positive, one neutral and one negative word in each target set. An item never appeared in more than two consecutive trials.  There were four trial types (recent no, 45 trials; non-recent no, 36 trials; recent yes, 27 trials; and non-recent yes, 36 trials) which were divided equally among three valence conditions ( negative, neutral and positive ). A recent no response trial is a trial, in which the probe word did not match any items in the current target set (requiring a “no” response), but matched one of the words from each of the two previous target sets; a non-recent no response trial is a trial in which the probe word did not match any items in the current target set (requiring a “no” response) nor from the two previous target sets; a recent yes response trial is trial, in which the probe word matched an item in the current target set (requiring a “yes” response) and from the previous target set; and a non-recent yes response trial is a trial, in which the probe word matched an item in the current target set (requiring a “yes” response), but did not match any of the items from the previous set. The valence of each trial was determined by the probe word.  The difference score in accurate response times (RTs) between the recent no and non-recent no trials reflects the amount of interference that needs to be resolved [30] . Data preparation for the RT measures can be found in [7] . Interference scores were calculated separately for each valence (negative, neutral, positive). A higher score implies a higher amount of interference that participants needed to resolve [30] . Since results from our previous article [7] were focused on negative interference levels (calculated as the difference score between the interference scores from negative and neutral trials), this was also the variable used in this study. Descriptive statistics are presented in Table 3 .   Statistical model  To examine the impact of reappraisal and rumination on negative emotions in daily life, we used a similar multilevel regression modeling approach as presented in [7] . At Level 1, we modeled how affect (e.g., anger/anxiety) at time t+1 can be predicted by the use of an emotion regulation strategy at time t+1 (e.g., reappraisal, which was assessed “since the last beep”), controlling for the affect at the previous time t . This reflects the extent to which use of the emotion regulation strategy between times t and t+1 is associated with a change in affect from time t to time t+1 , where time t to t+ 1 refers to two consecutive beeps within the same day:  At Level 2, we modeled how the reappraisal-angry/anxious slope ( ) is a function of individual differences in updating ability:  Such a multilevel model was estimated separately for each negative and positive emotion score (anger/anxiety, sadness/dysphoria, happiness, relaxation) and emotion regulation strategy (reappraisal/rumination).   Results   Preliminary analyses  We present the descriptive statistics and associations among the different variables in Table 3 . Rumination, reappraisal, and ER mean were all positively associated with the negative emotion measures (i.e., anger/anxiety, sadness/dysphoria) and negatively related with the positive emotion measures (except for reappraisal, which was non-significant). With regards to the relationships between the emotional n- back measure and daily life variables, there was a significant negative relationship between performance on the emotional n -back (accuracy scores) and average use of reappraisal. No other significant associations were found.  There was a positive correlation between the accuracy and RT scores of the emotional n- back ( r  = .23, p  = .02), implying a speed-accuracy tradeoff. Using multilevel analyses, with daily variables as the Level 1 outcome and RT scores of the emotional n- back as Level 2 predictors, we found no significant associations between the RT scores of the emotional n -back and the daily life variables (rumination: γ 21  = .21, SE  = 1.54, p  = .89; reappraisal: γ 21  = −1.46, SE  = 1.14, p  = .20; anger/anxiety: γ 21  = −1.59, SE  = 1.17, p  = .18; sadness/dysphoria: γ 21  = −1.21, SE  = 1.39, p  = .39; happiness: γ 21  = .98, SE  = 1.19, p  = .41; relaxation: γ 21  = .96, SE  = 1.11, p  = .39; ER mean: γ 21  = −.81, SE  = 1.06, p  = .45).   Reappraisal and negative emotions (uncorrected raw scores)  Results are presented in Table 4 . We found a significant positive relationship between reappraisal and anger/anxiety, and between reappraisal and sadness/dysphoria (see γ 20 scores in Table 4 ). This suggests that on average levels of updating ability, more use of reappraisal was associated with an increase of both high and low arousal negative emotions.  10.1371/journal.pone.0069071.t004 Table 4  Multilevel Analyses on the Moderating Effect of the Emotional n-back on the Relationship between Rumination/Reappraisal and Emotions in Daily Life.

Coef = coefficient. In each analysis, the predictors at Level 1 were group-mean centered. Each of the Level 2 variables were grand-mean centered. The intercept ( γ  20 ) reflects the efficacy of an emotion regulation strategy on change in affect at average levels of updating ability across participants. The slope ( γ 21 ) reflects the association between updating ability and the efficacy of an emotion regulation strategy on change in affect.  Only the relationship between reappraisal and anger/anxiety (and not sadness/dysphoria) was moderated by performance on the emotional n -back (see γ 21 scores in Table 4 ). Using simple slope analysis [23] , we found that participants with high updating scores (i.e., 1 SD above the mean) experienced a smaller increase in high arousal negative emotions when reappraising (γ 21  = .04, SE  = .02, p  = .01) compared to participants with low updating scores (i.e., 1 SD below the mean; γ 21  = .11, SE  = .02, p <.01).  RT scores of the emotional n- back did not moderate the relationships between reappraisal on one hand, and anger/anxiety ( γ 21  = −.03, SE  = .02, p  = .11) and sadness/dysphoria ( γ 21  = −.01, SE  = .02, p  = .77), on the other hand.   Rumination and negative emotions (uncorrected raw scores)  We found a significant positive relationship between rumination and anger/anxiety, and rumination and sadness/dysphoria (see γ 20 scores in Table 4 ). That is, at average levels of updating ability, more use of rumination was associated with an increase of both high and low arousal negative emotions. Similar to the reappraisal results, only the relationship between rumination and anger/anxiety (and not sadness/dysphoria) was marginally significantly moderated by performance on the emotional n -back (see γ 21 scores in Table 4 ). Using simple slope analysis [23] , we found that participants with high updating ability had a smaller increase in high arousal negative emotions when ruminating (γ 21  = .16, SE  = .02, p <.01) compared to participants with low updating ability (γ 21  = .21, SE  = .02, p <.01).  RT scores from the emotional n -back moderated the relationship between rumination and anger/anxiety ( γ 21  = −.05, SE  = .02, p <.01), but not with sadness/dysphoria ( γ 21  = −.02, SE  = .02, p  = .30).   Reappraisal and rumination and positive emotions (uncorrected raw scores)  To be consistent with the presentation of results in Study 1, we also report the moderating role of updating on the relationship of both reappraisal and rumination on change in positive emotions (see Table 4 ). At average levels of updating ability, rumination was related to a decrease of both high and low arousal positive emotions, while no significant relationship was found between reappraisal and positive emotions. Moreover, performance on the emotional n -back did not moderate the effect of both rumination and reappraisal on any of the positive emotion measures (see γ 21 scores in Table 4 ).  RT scores of the emotional n- back did not moderate the relationships between reappraisal on one hand and happiness ( γ 21  = .01, SE  = .02, p  = .64) and relaxation ( γ 21  = .03, SE  = .02, p  = .15) on the other hand. It also did not moderate the relationships between rumination on one hand and happiness ( γ 21  = .03, SE  = .02, p  = .15) and relaxation on the other hand ( γ 21  = .03, SE  = .03, p  = .20).   Updating with rumination and reappraisal while controlling for ER mean  It was counterintuitive to find that reappraisal would be related to an increase in negative emotions. Similar to the argument we made in a previous article [7] , this result could be explained by people’s tendency to just use various emotion regulation strategies when they are experiencing negative emotions. This assumption is supported in Table 3 , where a positive correlation between overall use of emotion regulation strategies and the experience of negative emotions was found.  In order to control for this confound, we re-ran the same analyses while adding overall use of emotion regulation strategies as a Level 1 covariate. This allowed us to determine how much participants used rumination or reappraisal over and above their overall use of emotion regulation strategies since the last beep. Results are presented in Table 4 .   Reappraisal and negative emotions (controlling for ER Mean)  After controlling for the overall use of emotion regulation strategies, we now found a significant negative relationship between reappraisal and anger/anxiety, and between reappraisal and sadness/dysphoria (see γ 20 scores in Table 4 ). This suggests that on average levels of updating ability, relative high reappraisal was associated with a decrease of both high and low arousal negative emotions.  In addition, we found that only the relationship between relative reappraisal and anger/anxiety was moderated by performance on the emotional n -back, while this was not the case for sadness/dysphoria (see γ 21 scores in Table 4 ). Simple slope analysis [23] revealed that participants who were better at updating emotional stimuli on the n -back task experienced a larger decrease in high arousal negative emotions when they were reappraising more relative to employing other emotion regulation strategies (γ 21  = −.08, SE  = .02, p <.01). However, for participants with low updating ability, there was no change in high arousal negative emotions when they were using reappraisal more relative to other emotion regulation strategies (γ 21  = −.01, SE  = .02, p  = .47). Figure 2 (left panel) illustrates this interaction effect.  10.1371/journal.pone.0069071.g002 Figure 2  Illustration of the moderating effect of overall updating ability (as measured by the emotional n-back) on the relationship between reappraisal (left panel) and rumination (right panel) on anger/anxiety emotional experience (high arousal negative emotions) in daily life.  Dashed and straight lines represent participants with low (-1 SD ) and high (+1 SD ) n -back scores, respectively. Low and high reappraisal scores are -1 SD and +1 SD from the overall mean, respectively. Low and high rumination scores were coded similarly.   RT scores from the emotional n -back moderated the relationship between reappraisal and anger/anxiety ( γ 21  = −.03, SE  = .01, p  = .03), but not with sadness/dysphoria ( γ 21  = −.01, SE  = .02, p  = .45).   Rumination and negative emotions (controlling for ER Mean)  After controlling for overall use of emotion regulation strategies, the results for rumination remained similar as the original analyses. Specifically, we found a significant positive relationship between relative rumination and anger/anxiety, and rumination and sadness/dysphoria (see γ 20 scores in Table 4 ). In addition, only the relationship between rumination and anger/anxiety was moderated by performance on the emotional n -back, while this was not the case for sadness/dysphoria (see γ 21 scores in Table 4 ). Simple slope analysis [23] revealed that participants who had high ability in updating emotional stimuli had a smaller increase in high arousal negative emotions when they were particularly ruminating relative to employing other emotion regulation strategies (γ 21  = .11, SE  = .02, p <.01) compared to those with lower updating ability (γ 21  = .16, SE  = .02, p <.01). See also Figure 2, right panel .  RT scores from the emotional n -back moderated the relationship between rumination and anger/anxiety ( γ 21  = −.06, SE  = .02, p <.01), but not with sadness/dysphoria ( γ 21  = −.02, SE  = .02, p  = .18).   Reappraisal and rumination and positive emotions (controlling for ER Mean)  At average levels of updating ability, relative rumination was related to a decrease in positive emotions, while relative reappraisal was now related to an increase in positive emotions (see γ 20 scores in Table 4 ). However, performance on the emotional n -back did not moderate the relationship between rumination and positive emotions, and reappraisal and positive emotions (see γ 21 scores in Table 4 ).  RT scores from the emotional n -back moderated the relationship between reappraisal and relaxation (although marginal; γ 21  = .04, SE  = .02, p  = .07), but not with happiness ( γ 21  = .02, SE  = .02, p  = .37). It also did not moderate the relationships between rumination on one hand and relaxation ( γ 21  = .03, SE  = .02, p  = .24) and happiness ( γ 21  = .02, SE  = .02, p  = .27) on the other hand.   Updating with rumination and reappraisal while controlling for ER mean  Similar to Study 1, to discount the possibility that updating ability (as measured by accuracy scores) may be partly confounded by effort or compliance in doing the task, we also performed analyses only with participants who responded to at least 75% of the relevant trials (i.e., 66 out of 88 trials; n = 92). Results remained the same.   Updating with rumination and reappraisal while controlling for inhibition of negative stimuli  To preclude the possibility that the shared variance of updating and inhibition of negative information, and not the specific updating of emotional information would predict the present findings, we ran the same models as above (i.e., models that include the ER Mean as a Level 1 predictor) while controlling for inhibition of negative information. That is, in addition to the updating measure, the negative interference level was also included as a predictor for the person-specific intercept and slope values at Level 2.  Results showed that after controlling for inhibition of negative information, updating of emotional information remained a significant moderator of the relationship between rumination and reappraisal on one hand, and high arousal negative emotions on the other hand (see Table 5 ). This suggests that it is unlikely that the shared relationship between these two measures could explain the moderating effect of updating on the efficacy of rumination and reappraisal on high arousal negative emotions.  10.1371/journal.pone.0069071.t005 Table 5  Multilevel Analyses on the Moderating Effect of the Emotional n-back on the Relationship between Rumination/Reappraisal and Emotions in Daily Life after Controlling for Inhibition of Negative Information.

Discussion  In Study 2, we aimed to examine whether updating of emotional information would moderate the relationship between reappraisal and rumination, on one hand, and affective experience, on the other hand, in everyday life, and whether this effect would remain even after controlling for inhibition of negative information. Moreover, we wanted to examine whether this effect would be found not only with high but also with low arousal positive and negative emotions.  Results revealed that updating of emotional information moderated the effect of rumination and reappraisal on high arousal negative emotions (i.e., anger/anxiety) alone. We did not find this for low arousal negative emotions (i.e., sadness/dysphoria) or with positive emotions (i.e., happiness and relaxation). Specifically, participants who were better at updating emotional information experienced a larger decrease and a smaller increase in high arousal negative emotions when they were particularly reappraising and ruminating, respectively, relative to using other emotion regulation strategies. These results remained even after controlling for the ability to inhibit negative information.   General Discussion  The findings of the present study provided empirical support to the hypothesis put forward by Schmeichel and colleagues [12] : Individual differences in cognitive ability moderate the success or failure of emotion regulation strategies. Specifically, we found that updating of emotional information moderated the efficacy of both rumination and reappraisal on high arousal negative emotions at the trait level (Study 1) and in daily life (Study 2). That is, participants who were better at updating emotional information in WM, and habitually used rumination and reappraisal reported less elevated and more decreased high arousal negative emotions, respectively (Study 1). They also experienced a smaller increase and a larger decrease in high arousal negative emotions when ruminating and reappraising, respectively, in everyday life, and this result remained even after controlling for the moderating effect of negative interference levels (Study 2).  We did not expect that the relationship between updating ability and efficacy of rumination and reappraisal would consistently be limited to high arousal negative emotions. Although unforeseen, it coincides with previous work on the relationship between emotion and executive control [31] . Indeed, it has been hypothesized that particularly emotional content high in threat impair executive resources as attentional control is diverted towards the processing of high threat information (see [31] ). Once executive resources are depleted (even temporarily), fewer resources can be recruited to do subsequent tasks that also require executive control, such as emotion regulation [32] . High threat situations are of course primarly implicated in the generation of high arousal negative emotions such as anger and anxiety. We propose that participants with high updating ability would have more executive resources to spare after processing high threat emotional information, and therefore would still have enough resources to effectively regulate these emotions. This would not be the case for participants with low updating ability. After processing high threat emotional information, they would probably have depleted most of their executive resources, leaving them with fewer resources to effectively regulate their emotional experience in response to such events.  We also reiterate here the rationale for using accuracy scores as our main dependent variable rather than RTs. The current variant of the emotional n- back task is more difficult than the classical n- back (e.g., [33] ) or the emotional 2-back by Levens and Gotlib [13] . In both of these tasks, participants had to match the current stimulus with the stimulus n trials before. In our variant of the emotional n -back, there was an added complexity to the task: Participants had to first identify the valence of the new word before matching its valence with the word 2 trials back. This way, we ensure that participants were processing the emotional stimulus presented, and not just its perceptual features. However, because of this added complexity, accuracy scores on our variant of the emotional n -back were not as high (59% for Study 1; 67% for Study 2) compared to both the classical n -back (e.g., visual 2-back: 91%–92%; [33] ) and emotional 2 -back by Levens and Gotlib (76%–94%; [13] ) that are reported in the literature. The relatively lower accuracy scores for this variant of the n -back also make us hesitant to rely on RT scores, as RT scores only become a good measure of ability under the condition that accuracy levels are high (note that we nevertheless report RT results for completeness). Although we did not find any significant moderating effect of the RT scores in Study 1, we did in Study 2. In Study 2, we consistently found that longer RTs predicted smaller increase and larger decrease in high arousal negative emotions when ruminating and reappraising, respectively. However, this counterintuitive result can be explained by the positive correlation between RT and accuracy scores found in both studies. This implies a speed-accuracy trade-off, in which spending a longer time in responding results in better performance for this task [34] .  Although it is more appropriate to use accuracy scores as a measure of performance on this variant of the emotional n -back [18] , we cannot discount the possibility that this method of assessing updating ability may be partly confounded by effort or compliance in doing the task. Although this predicament is not uncommon when using cognitive ability measures (e.g., see [35] ), it is possible to minimize this confound by removing participants who have a relatively large amount of “no responses” or omissions in the emotional n- back. When reanalyzing the data set with participants who responded to at least 75% of all relevant trials (i.e., 66 out of 88 trials), we found that our findings remained largely the same, suggesting that it seems unlikely that our results can be explained in terms of effort alone.  This study extends previous work in several ways. First, we defined and tested cognitive ability in a different way. We focused on updating (as measured by the emotional n -back), which is an executive process that requires modifying the contents of WM to accommodate incoming newer relevant information [11] . Previous work on the moderating effect of cognitive ability on successful emotion regulation primarily focused on general working memory capacity (WMC; [12] , [36] ), which is defined as the “ability to sustain goal-relevant information processing in the presence of alternative goals or other distractions” ( [12] : p. 1527). Although these two processes are included in the broader construct of WM or executive functions, there is growing evidence that measures of WMC (e.g., operation span) and updating (e.g., n -back) do not load on the same WM component (e.g., [33] ). However, when we combine findings from previous studies [12] , [36] and the current investigation, the findings inform us that both WMC and updating play a moderating role on successful emotion regulation. Whether it is their shared variance or that they each independently predict successful emotion regulation remains an important question in the literature and should be investigated further in the future.  Second, to our knowledge, there are few, if any, studies that looked at the moderating role of cognitive ability on the success or failure of rumination (for exception, see [7] ). Previous studies have primarily focused on emotion regulation strategies, such as reappraisal [12] , [36] and suppression [12] . In the present study, we found that although rumination was associated with greater experience of high arousal negative emotions, better updating ability curbed this effect. That is, people who were better at updating tend to experience less elevated high arousal negative emotions at the trait level, and a smaller increase in high arousal negative emotions in daily life when they ruminated. This finding is important because it supports the notion that rumination involves elaboration of negative material that is already present in WM [13] . A person with poor updating ability would have difficulties allowing newer information to feed into WM, which would result into a continuous elaboration of current negative material in WM. A person with better updating ability would have a higher chance of breaking this cyclic process. As new information feeds into WM, the contents of WM also change, which then interrupts the elaboration of negative material when ruminating. As a result, this lessens the maladaptive effects of rumination.  Importantly, our results also showed that the role of updating on efficacy of emotion regulation extends to everyday life, going beyond results found in the laboratory. This methodological difference is important since results found in daily life give insight into experiences in real time, which is distinctive from trait questionnaires, wherein responses are reliant on how things are remembered [37] . Indeed, when participants were asked how much they regulated their emotions (since the last beep) and how they currently felt, results showed that participants who were better at updating showed a lesser increase in high arousal negative emotions when they ruminated, and a larger decrease in high arousal negative emotions when they reappraised. These findings were similar to what we found with trait questionnaires in Study 1, and what Schmeichel and colleagues [12] found in an experimental study (at least for reappraisal). The combination of various methodologies used to assess the moderating role of updating on efficacy of emotion regulation give stronger empirical support regarding the importance of cognitive ability in implementing emotion regulation strategies.  The current results give additional support to the assumption that updating ability is beneficial for overall well-being. Our previous findings have focused on the relationship of updating of positive information and the experience of subjective well-being or happiness [18] . The current findings point towards the importance of updating ability when regulating high arousal negative emotions. Specifically, the results seem to suggest that updating ability is a necessary component for the successful down-regulation of high arousal negative emotions when reappraising, and acts as a protective mechanism against the increase of high arousal negative emotions when ruminating.  Our results suggest ways to inform therapeutic interventions for mood disorders. While many therapeutic interventions are aimed at changing the strategies that people use to regulate their emotions (e.g., to reduce the use of rumination, or to increase the use of reappraisal), our findings indicate that training people’s updating ability could have the added benefit that it directly modulates the impact of both strategies in therapeutic ways.  However, one interesting area for future research is to investigate whether the relationship between updating and efficacy of rumination and reappraisal would differ between men and women. Because of the disproportionate number of men and women in our two studies, it was not possible to examine such gender differences in the present manuscript.   Conclusion  In conclusion, the present study reveals that the ability to update emotional information plays a role in the efficacy of rumination and reappraisal on regulating high arousal negative emotions. In two studies, results showed that people with better updating ability tend to experience more decreased and less elevated high arousal negative emotions when reappraising and ruminating, respectively, compared to others. These findings indicate that updating ability may be a critical component for successful emotion regulation.

We examined the influence of affective priming on the appreciation of abstract artworks using an evaluative priming task. Facial primes (showing happiness, disgust or no emotion) were presented under brief (Stimulus Onset Asynchrony, SOA = 20ms) and extended (SOA = 300ms) conditions. Differences in aesthetic liking for abstract paintings depending on the emotion expressed in the preceding primes provided a measure of the priming effect. The results showed that, for the extended SOA, artworks were liked more when preceded by happiness primes and less when preceded by disgust primes. Facial expressions of happiness, though not of disgust, exerted similar effects in the brief SOA condition. Subjective measures and a forced-choice task revealed no evidence of prime awareness in the suboptimal condition. Our results are congruent with findings showing that the affective transfer elicited by priming biases evaluative judgments, extending previous research to the domain of aesthetic appreciation.

We frequently value the aesthetic qualities of our surroundings and other people in terms of beauty, liking, or attractiveness. Psychological aesthetics aims to understand how these aesthetic responses arise from the interaction of object, person and context features [ 1 ]. However, influenced by formalist art theories, which conceive aesthetic appreciation fundamentally as a response to relations among formal features such as lines, forms, colors or spaces, psychologists have mostly focused on determining how object properties (e.g., complexity, symmetry, and proportion) impact aesthetic appreciation. A different and broader approach conceives the spectator not as a passive receiver of form, but as an active agent that contributes to shape aesthetic experiences into personal and unique events. Knowledge about an object, for instance, has a profound impact on people’s appreciation of it [ 2 – 4 ]. But people bring much more to the aesthetic experience than acquired knowledge. They engage with the objects of aesthetic experience in a certain mood, or after encountering other affective objects. This is the case, for instance, with museum visits, where many different artworks are viewed in succession. The goal of the present paper is to ascertain the extent to which previous affective states and experiences influence aesthetic appreciation.  Experimental psychologists have demonstrated that, in many contexts, the affective qualities of stimuli can influence the subsequent evaluation of other stimuli or situations, even when the initial processing is irrelevant to the task or lacks subjective awareness [ 5 , 6 ]. Affective states and processes can exert a strong influence on cognitive operations and, particularly, on high-level cognition, including interpretation, judgment, decision-making, and reasoning [ 7 ].  As an explanation for these effects, it has been suggested that affect biases the encoding, retrieval, and processing of information used to formulate evaluations and judgments, especially when demanding and constructive processing is required [ 8 ]. From the field of implicit social cognition, the Affect Misattribution Procedure (AMP) has been devised in order to study how affect elicited by unaware primes influences subsequent evaluations [ 9 ]. The results of a number of studies using the AMP are congruent with the assumption that the affective response to suboptimal primes is transferred (unconsciously misattributed) to the evaluative judgment. Among the factors that modulate the effects of affective priming, the stimuli onset asynchrony (SOA) and the kind of stimulus used as prime have received most attention. Comparisons of the impact of different SOAs have increased our understanding of how evaluation is biased by emotional information processing at different levels of awareness [ 6 , 10 ]. It seems well established that SOAs under 300ms lead to the most robust affective priming effects [ 11 ]. However, studies using facial expressions as primes have reported conflicting results. For instance, it was found that when facial expressions were displayed with SOAs of 1000ms priming effects were weaker (or even non detectable) than when a SOA 5ms was used [ 6 ]. Such results suggest that the strength of the priming effects of facial expressions var with SOA duration, as other kinds of visual stimuli. Other studies, conversely, found strong priming effects both with brief (17ms) and extended (1000ms) SOAs [ 12 ]. The importance of this discrepancy resides in the fact that the SOA is a crucial moderator of affective priming effects, playing a determinant role in participants’ awareness of primes. In any case, a SOA of 30ms seems to be short enough to prevent awareness when backward masking is applied [ 13 ].  Various classes of prime stimuli seem to have the potential to transfer their affective valence to target stimuli, including facial expressions, as noted above [ 6 , 12 ]. Since emotionally loaded stimuli are processed thoroughly, and facial expressions of emotion are natural affective stimuli with a relevant evolutionary significance, it is not surprising that numerous experimental studies report that certain expressions are perceived faster and more accurately than others. Some results [ 14 ] suggest that negative facial expressions with a high adaptive value (e.g., fear) are more perceptually or emotionally salient than happiness or neutral expressions. In contrast, other studies, such as those using backward visual masking [ 15 ] lend support to the traditional notion of the happy face advantage.  This controversy has extended into the affective priming literature. Whereas some studies show that happy expressions are more easily and more readily processed, especially with brief SOAs [ 12 , 16 , 17 ], others show that negative stimuli, including facial expressions, elicit the fastest processing and the strongest response bias, even at different levels of perceptual awareness [ 18 ]. Because most of this work has focused on the emotional expressions of happiness, anger, sadness, and fear, little is known about the extent to which other kinds, such as expressions of disgust, have biasing effects on cognitive processes. Thus, despite recent interest in the emotion of disgust, sparked in part due to its distinctive underlying neural network, its affective priming effects, compared to those of other emotions, have hardly been investigated. Till our knowledge, only one recent study [ 19 ] contrasted subliminal processing of fear and disgust. Although noting that fear expressions lead to stronger subliminal priming effects than disgust, the results showed that expressions of disgust are capable of inducing priming effects, particularly when serving as alarms for social threat in a context of true interaction. In sum, there is a need to clearly ascertain whether facial expressions of happiness and disgust are capable of producing priming effects to the same extent, and whether there are differences depending on the SOAs (i.e., brief vs. extended).  On the basis of the foregoing, the objective of this study is to ascertain the extent to which previously activated affective processing influences aesthetic liking for abstract art. As the above reviewed literature has shown, affective priming is an ideal paradigm to test the impact of affect on valuation. Given that affective responses are a critical source for people’s aesthetic appraisals [ 1 ], it can be assumed that the affective quality of briefly presented primes will influence the aesthetic evaluations of subsequently presented targets. The empirical study of the effects of affect misattribution on aesthetic appreciation has the potential of increasing our understanding of the effect of affective processes, and their temporal dynamics, on aesthetic evaluations [ 20 – 22 ]. Moreover, although the interaction between emotion and cognition has been suggested to be especially relevant in aesthetic evaluation tasks [ 1 ], very few experimental studies have directly examined how this interaction takes place.  In addition to extending the analysis of affect’s bias on evaluation into a new domain, the present study addresses the issues outlined above by means of a similar task to those used in evaluative priming research, incorporating some recent adaptations of the affect misattribution procedure [ 23 ].  Specifically, this study contrasts two main hypotheses. First, since it is presumed that the affect elicited by facial expression primes (happiness, disgust or no emotion) is transferred to the targets, differences in aesthetic evaluation of the target stimuli (abstract artworks) are expected. The direction of the effect is hypothesized to depend on the type of prime (lower ratings for disgust primes, higher ratings for happiness primes). Second, in line with previous research [ 6 , 16 ], the affective priming effect, both for disgust and happiness primes, is expected to be stronger in the suboptimal condition (brief SOA)—thus influencing the subsequent aesthetic appreciation to a greater degree—than in the optimal condition (extended SOA). Additionally, we designed the experiment to allow an exploration of the time course of the predicted priming effects over blocks.    Methods   Participants  Sixty-one undergraduate students, 30 female (mean age = 20.40, SD = 1.868) and 31 male (mean age = 20.23, SD = 1.586) volunteered to participate in this study. None of them had any kind of art expertise, and all had normal or corrected-to-normal vision. As an incentive, they received a breakfast voucher for their participation. All participants gave written informed consent. The experiment was approved by the Ethical Committee of the Comunitat Autònoma de les Illes Balears (Spain).    Materials and stimuli  Twenty-four pictures of facial expressions selected from the Montreal Set of Facial Displays of Emotion (MSFDE) [ 24 ] were used as primes. They were selected pseudo-randomly from the Latino and Caucasian sets to include 8 instances of each of the chosen expressions (i.e., happiness, disgust, and neutral), and to represent male and female models equally in each of the three emotional categories.  The target stimuli were 8 different portions cropped from 3 abstract paintings by Hans Hartung and 8 different portions cropped from 3 abstract paintings by Jackson Pollock. These artworks were selected according to the following criteria: First, all paintings had to be abstract because of the required ambiguity and to avoid undesired memory effects. Second, since a number of very similar targets were needed, the fragments to be used had to be taken from paintings belonging to a single series by each artist.    Procedure  Participants were told that they would have to evaluate a series of artworks in terms of how much they liked them aesthetically. They were requested to follow their initial impression, not to meditate their response for too long. Participants were also told that, just before the artworks, they might briefly see pictures of faces, which in some trials might hardly even be noticed, and that they should ignore them. The task was divided into two phases and three blocks, with 96 trials per block. The aim of the main phase, consisting of the first two blocks, was to measure the affective priming effects on aesthetic appreciation. The inclusion of the second block allowed us to examine the potential changes in the affective priming effect over time. In contrast, the second phase (third block) aimed to determine participants’ level of awareness of the primes.  The first block consisted of 48 trials under optimal (SOA 300ms) conditions and 48 under suboptimal (SOA 20ms) conditions. The 96 trials were presented pseudo-randomly, avoiding displaying the same primes (facial expressions of emotion) or targets (artworks) consecutively. For each SOA condition, each target was presented three times, one for each type of prime (happiness, disgust, or neutral). Each trial started with a 500ms presentation of a fixation cross in the center of the screen. At the offset of the fixation cross, the prime was presented (for 20ms or 300ms), and was immediately followed (ISI = 0ms) by a target picture, which also served as a backward mask. Once the target appeared, participants had to evaluate their degree of aesthetic liking for each particular target through a 5-point Likert scale (1 = dislike very much; 5 = like very much). Target stimuli remained on the screen until participants responded.  The second block was identical to the first one. Once the second block finished, participants were asked to complete a self-report questionnaire to assess their phenomenological awareness of the primes. The questionnaire consisted of two questions, one of them referred to the perception of the prime, and the other one referred to the perception of the facial expression. The following example illustrates both questions: “Throughout the latter set of items, how many times have you been able to perceive the face/facial expression that appears briefly before each painting?” In this case, the Likert scale indicated was: 1 = None, 2 = Sometimes, 3 = Approximately half of the times, 4 = Most of the times, 5 = All of the times.  In the third block only the brief SOA was used, and a forced choice task was included after each trial. This way, participants had to rate again every artwork and, inmediately after that, they had to identify the prime that they had just seen before that artwork. Thus, after the target evaluation, the prime was presented again together with a distractor, which was either the same actor expressing another emotion, or another actor expressing the same emotion. The specific task participants were requested to perform —to discriminate the facial expression or the identity of the face —was randomized across trials. No temporal restrictions were imposed, so the two images remained on the screen until participants made their choice by pressing the button on the left (“1” key of the keyboard) or on the right (“2” key). The side of the screen on which the test faces appeared was also randomized (i.e., left vs. right, respect to the central horizontal axis). Both tasks were performed on 48 trials. After this block, another self-report questionnaire asked the participants the level of confidence that they had in their responses with two questions, both illustrated in the following example: “With what level of confidence have you chosen between the two faces/facial expressions we presented after each painting?” The Likert scale was: 1 = No confidence, 2 = Little confidence, 3 = Neither much nor little confidence, 4 = Very confident, 5 = With total confidence.  Participants performed 4 practice trials before each block (two with each SOA), in which they evaluated abstract paintings by other artists. Data from the practice trials were not analyzed. In order to prevent participants’ fatigue, they took a 5-minute break between blocks.     Results  Because ratings in the two first blocks had to be based on participants’ initial impression, and because we wished to exclude anticipated answers, responses with latencies over 2000ms or below 300ms were excluded prior to analysis (2.84% of all responses, 1.81% and 1.03% respectively). A 2 x 3 x 2 ANOVA was conducted, with SOA (20ms vs. 300ms), Type of Prime (happiness, disgust, or neutral) and Block (1st vs. 2nd) as factors, and ratings for aesthetic liking as dependent variable.  We found a main effect of Type of Prime, F(1.243, 74.59) = 16.168, MSE = .759, p < .001, ηp 2 = .212, and a significant interaction between SOA and Type of Prime, F(1.8,107.9) = 5.803, MSE = .099, p = .005, ηp 2 = .088. Within the extended SOA level aesthetic liking ratings for artworks were significantly higher when primed with happiness expressions than when primed with disgust expressions, F(1,60) = 20.255, MSE = .276, p < .001, ηp 2 = .252, and than when primed with neutral expressions, F(1,60) = 17.242, MSE = .172, p < .001, ηp 2 = .223. They were significantly lower when primed with disgust expressions than neutral ones, F(1,60) = 7.465, MSE = .056, p = .008, ηp 2 = .111. In contrast, within the brief SOA level, priming with happiness expressions also increased the liking ratings in comparison with the disgust expressions, F(1,60) = 10.664, MSE = .171, p = .002, ηp 2 = .151, and the neutral expressions, F(1,60) = 12.058, MSE = .115, p = .001, ηp 2 =.167, but liking for the artworks did not differ when primed with disgust or neutral expressions, F(1,60) = .600, MSE = .051, p = .442.  On the other hand, there were significant differences in aesthetic liking as a result of SOA only for the disgust prime, F(1,60) = 7.638, MSE = .063, p = .008, ηp 2 = .113. The aesthetic liking scores for targets preceded by primes expressing disgust were lower in the extended SOA condition than in the brief SOA condition.  With regards to the variations of the affective priming effect over time, although the SOA x Block interaction was not significant, F(1,60) = 3.742, MSE = .042, p = .058, ηp 2 = .059, the effect size reaches the usual standard value for a medium effect. Nevertheless, the simple effects analyses, taking into account the Type of Prime, show no significant effects between blocks, both for brief and extended SOAs. In addition, the comparison of the effects of the Type of Prime between SOAs for each block showed no differences in the Block 1, neither for disgust, F(1,60) = 1.761, MSE = .086, p = .190, nor for neutral primes, F(1,60) = .466, MSE = .068, p= .498. However, the difference for happiness primes showed a trend effect, F(1,60) = 2.983, MSE = .079, p = .089, ηp 2 = .047, suggesting a tendency in the aesthetic liking ratings to be greater for the optimal priming condition for this kind of prime. In the case of the Block 2, the results showed no differences for happiness, F(1,60) = .349, MSE = .091, p = .557, nor for neutral primes, F(1,60) = 1.272, MSE = .049, p = .264. Conversely, the difference for disgust primes was significant, F(1,60) = 8.915, MSE = .107, p = .004, ηp2 = .129, revealing that ratings were lower in the optimal priming condition. Inspection of the means suggests that this significant difference seems to be caused by the fact that the aesthetic ratings for artworks following disgust primes decrease over blocks, though only in the optimal priming condition. In fact, in the suboptimal priming condition they were slightly higher in the second block. In contrast, ratings for artworks primed with expressions of happiness decrease over blocks both for optimal and suboptimal conditions (see Table 1 ).   10.1371/journal.pone.0080154.t001 Table 1   Mean liking ratings for each SOA, type of prime and block.

Regarding the level of awareness, both the self-report results and the forced choice task suggest that, for the brief SOA, the primes were hardly ever consciously perceived. Specifically, the conducted analysis show that participants’ choices did not differ from chance when discriminating the identity, t(60) = -.156, p = .877, r = -.02, or the expression of the faces presented as primes, t(60) = 1.809, p = .075, r = .22.    Discussion  The first of this study’s three main objectives was to ascertain whether the selected affective primes (disgust, happiness, and neutral) produced different effects on aesthetic liking for abstract artworks. Our analyses revealed that this was indeed the case. With the extended and brief SOAs, aesthetic liking scores were higher when the artworks were preceded by happiness primes than by either of the other two kinds. Additionally, aesthetic ratings for artworks primed with expressions of disgust were lower than when primed with neutral expressions, though only when using the extended SOA.  Our results, thus, support the happy face advantage hypothesis [ 17 ], showing that it holds under optimal and suboptimal conditions, and extend it to an aesthetic appreciation task. Following previous results not related with the aesthetics domain [ 9 ], it could be inferred that the affective transfer from the primes to the abstract artworks occurred to a greater extent for the happiness than for the disgust facial expressions. We found no evidence suggesting that the stronger evaluative bias elicited by negative primes observed in some previous studies [ 18 ] carries over into the domain of aesthetic evaluation.  Our second objective was to investigate whether happiness and disgust primes caused stronger effects on the aesthetic evaluation ratings for the brief SOA (suboptimal priming in which no evidence of prime awareness was found) than for the extended SOA (optimal priming with prime awareness). The results confirmed that SOA magnitude indeed modulated priming effects. Contrary to our hypothesis, although we found no differences between suboptimal and optimal priming condition for happiness facial expressions, the negative effect of disgust was weaker in the suboptimal priming condition. In fact, expressions of disgust in this condition had no greater impact on liking for the artworks than neutral expressions.  This evidence, on the one hand, questions previous work suggesting that facial expression primes exert little or no effect under high awareness conditions [ 6 , 25 ], but it is congruent with the results obtained by other authors [ 12 , 13 , 26 ]. The stronger effect of the expression of happiness, on the other hand, fits well with prior studies showing its greater effectiveness or “salience” in relation to other facial expressions [ 12 , 17 ]. The fact that the priming effect of facial expressions of disgust was limited to the optimal priming condition could be due to the expression of disgust having a lower evolutionary relevance than other negative expressions, such as anger or fear [ 12 ]. It could be also related with the absence of a context of potential threat, a factor that has been shown to be crucial for producing suboptimal affective priming effects by means of facial expressions of disgust [ 19 ]. Further research is needed to study the effect of additional negative facial expressions and other types of emotional primes or target stimuli (including artworks), as well as to contrast the effects of different prime exposures.  Our last objective was to ascertain the between-blocks time course of the effects. Although results related to the variation of the priming effects between blocks are not conclusive, they moderately suggest that the effectiveness of the affective transfer remains longer for expressions of disgust than for expressions of happiness in the extended SOA condition. The endurance of the effect of priming with expressions of disgust with extended SOAs seems to underscore the temporal robustness and resistance to repetition of the effects of optimal priming by means of disgust faces on aesthetic appreciation.  In sum, our results show that previously described priming effects on the evaluation of ambiguous stimuli extend to the evaluation of abstract art, and indicate that people’s prior affective state contributes significantly to the aesthetic appreciation of art. Positive affect increases liking for abstract art, while negative affect decreases it, especially when induced using longer exposure times, such as those that characterize a museum visit. Our results suggest that the affective state induced by one artwork could influence the aesthetic experience of the next, and thus challenge the view that emphasizes the role of object features in the aesthetic experience and relegates the contribution of personal experiences and states to a marginal role. Further studies should explore the effects of affective priming on other aesthetic assessments such as aesthetic preference, “beauty” evaluations and aesthetic quality judgments [ 20 ], enriching the theoretical discussions about the role of the emotions in the emergence of aesthetic experience [ 22 ].

Background  Beyond providing cues about an agent's intention, communicative actions convey information about the presence of a second agent towards whom the action is directed (second-agent information). In two psychophysical studies we investigated whether the perceptual system makes use of this information to infer the presence of a second agent when dealing with impoverished and/or noisy sensory input.    Methodology/Principal Findings  Participants observed point-light displays of two agents (A and B) performing separate actions. In the Communicative condition, agent B's action was performed in response to a communicative gesture by agent A. In the Individual condition, agent A's communicative action was replaced with a non-communicative action. Participants performed a simultaneous masking yes-no task, in which they were asked to detect the presence of agent B. In Experiment 1, we investigated whether criterion c was lowered in the Communicative condition compared to the Individual condition, thus reflecting a variation in perceptual expectations. In Experiment 2, we manipulated the congruence between A's communicative gesture and B's response, to ascertain whether the lowering of c in the Communicative condition reflected a truly perceptual effect. Results demonstrate that information extracted from communicative gestures influences the concurrent processing of biological motion by prompting perception of a second agent (second-agent effect).    Conclusions/Significance  We propose that this finding is best explained within a Bayesian framework, which gives a powerful rationale for the pervasive role of prior expectations in visual perception.

Consider for example the gesture of pointing: This referential gesture works by directing the attention of another agent to some location in the surrounding environment. Even if no other person is visible in the scene, an observer watching an agent performing such a gesture would assume that there is a second person towards whom the gesture is directed [4] . This grants communicative gestures a special informational status: Beyond providing information about the actor, they also convey information about the presence of an interaction partner towards whom the action is directed (second-agent information).  The present study aimed at investigating to what extent, in the presence of impoverished and/or noisy visual information, the perceptual system makes use of this information to infer the presence of a second agent. Using a simultaneous masking detection task, Manera, Becchio, Schouten, Bara, and Verfaillie [5] demonstrated that observing a communicative gesture facilitates visual discrimination of a second agent. Participants observed point-light displays of two agents (A and B) performing separate actions. In the communicative condition, the action of agent B was performed in response to a communicative gesture performed by agent A. In the individual condition, agent A's communicative action was replaced with a non-communicative action. Results (in a two-alternative forced choice task) showed that observing the communicative gesture performed by agent A enhanced visual detection of agent B, embedded in a noise mask of moving point lights. These findings suggest that second-agent information facilitates perception of another agent by allowing observers to predict the other person's action. Put differently, in the context of a communicative interaction, the action of one agent can serve as a predictor of the other agent's action. But what happens when no other agent is in fact present? Are observers prompted to infer the presence of a second agent even when no agent is actually there?  In Bayesian terms, the function of the perceptual system is to build a plausible model of the world by optimally integrating currently available sensory evidence with expectations about the state of the external environment ( priors , [6] , [7] ). There is convincing evidence that low-level perceptual activity can be modulated by higher-level cognitive factors [8] and that expectations – either induced by instructions or based on the statistical distribution of previous sensory inputs - can strongly affect the contents of visual awareness [9] , [10] . Critically, reliance on prior expectations has been shown to vary according to the type of observed action. For simple goal directed actions such as lifting an arm or pressing a button, perceptual judgment primarily relies on the external visual input. For actions directed at more complex goals (e.g., actions requiring the execution of a combination of basic actions) prior expectations exert a stronger influence, to the detriment of the available sensory information. A similar over-reliance on priors is reported when observed actions fit into a context of social interaction: Prior expectations are favored over visual information [11] . In this framework, observing a communicative action should influence perception by increasing the prior probability that a second-agent is present in the scene. This updating of prior expectations can be expected to bias observer's performance especially when stimulus-driven processing is made more difficult (e.g., by simultaneous masking). Indeed, the less reliable the input, the more perception is influenced by the prior. As a result, observers might be induced to perceive a second agent, irrespectively of whether a second agent is in fact present or not.  Signal detection theory (SDT) provides a suitable tool to investigate this process [12] , [13] . In SDT, participants' correct responses and errors in a detection task are used to estimate two parameters, the sensitivity ( d′ ) and the response criterion ( c ). Sensitivity is a measure of the individual's ability to discriminate between signal and noise (e.g., between presence and absence of a second agent in an animated clip); higher values of d′ (ranging from 0 to +∞) indicate better discrimination ability. The response criterion is a complex parameter, reflecting both the expected likelihood of the signal being present in the stimulus and the decision process involved in the response. Lower values of c (ranging from −∞ to +∞) may indicate (a) a higher expected probability that the signal will be present, and/or (b) a more liberal decision threshold, requiring a lower degree of certainty before a positive response is given. If observing a communicative gesture increases the probability of perceiving a second agent - whether or not a second agent is in fact present - then a lower response criterion should be observed in visual detection of a human agent. Specifically, let P(S) be the expected (prior) probability of signal (i.e., a second agent is present), and P(N) be the expected (prior) probability of noise (i.e., there is no second agent); the optimal response criterion c * is  Thus, when the prior probability of a second agent being present increases, the optimal response criterion will decrease accordingly. Here, we tested this hypothesis in two psychophysical experiments.   Overview of Experiments and Results   Experiment 1  In Experiment 1, participants viewed point-light stimuli of two human figures belonging to two experimental conditions. Stimuli in the Communicative condition displayed a communicative interaction between two agents, with agent A performing a communicative gesture towards a second agent (B), who responded accordingly (e.g., A asks B to squat down, B squats down). Stimuli in the Individual condition were assembled by replacing agent A's communicative action with a non-communicative action (e.g., A turns, B squats down). Participants performed a simultaneous masking yes-no task, in which they were asked to discriminate between signal trials (containing agent B), and noise trials (not containing agent B).  The results of Experiment 1 showed that the criterion was lower in the Communicative condition than in the Individual condition. This suggests that observing a communicative gesture increased the probability of perceiving a second agent, regardless of whether a second agent was in fact present or not. However, an alternative explanation might be that observers were simply more inclined to report a signal in the Communicative condition compared to the Individual condition. If this were the case, the lowered criterion in the Communicative condition might reflect mere response bias. A second experiment was designed to resolve this issue, by manipulating the congruency of the two agents' actions in the Communicative condition.    Experiment 2  The aim of Experiment 2 was to ascertain whether the lowered criterion in the Communicative condition in Experiment 1 reflected a perceptual effect (i.e., an increased likelihood of perceiving a second agent) rather than mere response bias (i.e., an increased tendency to respond “yes”). To this end, we extended Experiment 1 by adding a third experimental condition, i.e. a Communicative-incongruent condition , in which agent B's response (e.g., B squats down) did not match A's communicative gesture (e.g., A asks B to come closer). If the lowered criterion reflected mere response bias, no difference in c should be observed between the Communicative-congruent condition and the Communicative-incongruent condition. In contrast, if observers were truly more likely to perceive a second agent, we would expect a significant decrease in c in the Communicative-congruent condition compared to the Communicative-incongruent condition. This is because in the congruent condition, but not in the incongruent condition, the actions of agent A can be used to anticipate the actions of agent B. We expected this to occur in both signal and noise trials, as the noise trials contain elements of the corresponding actions of agent B (see Experiment 1: Method).  Experiment 2 replicated the finding of Experiment 1, suggesting that observers were more likely to see a second agent when presented with Communicative-congruent actions compared with individual actions. Also, the criterion was significantly lower in the Communicative-congruent condition compared to the Communicative-incongruent condition; this rules out the possibility that the second-agent effect only reflects changes in response bias. Indeed, if our results were fully accounted for by response bias, the same lowering of response criterion should have been observed in both communicative conditions. The data from a post-experiment questionnaire further supported a perceptual interpretation, by showing that, when incorrectly reporting the presence of agent B, participants reported perceiving a human figure (or part of it).      Methods   Experiment 1   Participants  Twenty-three undergraduate and graduate students from the University of Turin (8 male and 15 female, mean age = 26.5 years, age range 21–34) volunteered to take part in the experiment. All had normal or corrected-to-normal vision, had provided informed written consent and were naïve with respect to the purpose of the study. The study was approved by the Ethical Committee of the Faculty of Psychology of the University of Turin and was conducted in accordance with the ethical standards laid down in the 1964 Declaration of Helsinki.    Stimuli  Stimuli consisted of two point-light figures with 13 markers indicating the centre of the major joints of a person (head, shoulders, elbows, wrists, hips, knees, and feet). 10 point-light stimuli were employed, 5 belonging to the Communicative condition and 5 belonging to the Individual condition. Stimuli in the Communicative condition displayed a communicative interaction between two agents, with agent A performing a communicative gesture towards a second agent (B), who responded accordingly. These stimuli were selected from the Communicative Interaction Database (CID [14] ) and included: ‘Get down’, ‘Pick it up’, ‘Look at that (ceiling)’, ‘Help yourself’, and ‘Sit down’. Stimuli in the Individual condition were assembled by replacing agent A's communicative action with a non-communicative action executed with the same onset and duration (‘Turn’, ‘Jump’, ‘Sneeze’, ‘Lateral step’, and ‘Drink’). In both the Communicative and the Individual conditions, agent B's action (e.g., ‘picking something up’) was always coupled with a fixed action by agent A (‘pointing to something to be picked up’ in the Communicative condition; ‘jumping’ in the Individual condition).  Stimuli were constructed combining motion capture techniques and animation software [15] . For the Communicative condition the actions of the two actors were captured simultaneously, in order to guarantee that B's response matched A's communicative gesture in all respects (e.g. timing, position, kinematics). A and B were always visible, but the onset of A's action always preceded that of B's action. For the Individual condition A's action was captured while the actor was acting alone and was then coupled with B's action, so as to maintain the same temporal structure as in the communicative interaction (i.e., A's action had the same onset and duration as in the Communicative condition). Stimulus duration ranged from 3,600 to 8,200 ms. In both the Communicative and the Individual conditions, agent A and agent B remained approximately at a constant distance from the centre of the screen for the whole duration of the action and never physically touched one another. In all action stimuli (in both the Individual and in the Communicative conditions), the agents always faced each other. Previous research employing the present stimuli has shown that communicative and individual actions can be clearly distinguished, and that gestures can be easily identified by untrained observers (see Manera et al. [14] for a description of stimulus recognisability).    Apparatus and procedure  Stimuli were presented on a 15.4-inch WXGA screen (display resolution: 1280×800; refresh rate: 60 Hz) using MatLab (7.1 version) software. Viewing distance was 60 cm. Stimuli were black against a grey background, and were rendered from a three-quarter view (corresponding to the 125° reference orientation used in the CID). The visual angle between the points attached to the head and the foot was about 7.15 deg and individual points subtended approximately 0.14 deg each. Participants were tested individually in a dimly lit room.  As we were interested in variations in criterion, we did not use a forced-choice task as in Manera et al. [5] , but a yes-no task [16] . Participants were asked to distinguish between two kind of trials: signal trials (containing agent B) and noise trials (not containing agent B). In signal trials , B's actions were displayed using a limited lifetime technique and masked with limited lifetime noise dots [17] , [18] . Each signal dot was presented for a fixed duration (200 ms) at one of the 13 possible locations, then disappeared and reappeared at another randomly chosen location. Six signal dots per frame were shown. Dot appearance and disappearance were asynchronous across dots in order to avoid motion transients from simultaneous transitions of all sampling dots. Noise dots had the same trajectories, size, and duration as the signal dots, but were temporally and spatially scrambled (they appeared in a region sustaining a visual angle of approximately 8.6 deg horizontally and 14.3 deg vertically). The number of noise dots was adjusted individually for each participant in a training session (see below). In noise trials , agent B was substituted by limited lifetime scrambled dots obtained by temporally scrambling the corresponding signal action. Noise dots were also added so as to obtain the same number of dots as displayed in the signal trials. Because the position and motion of the dots in noise trials equaled (on average) those of signal trials, noise trials were perceptually similar to the corresponding signal trials [17] . In both signal and noise trials, A was neither limited lifetime nor masked (see Figure 1 ).   10.1371/journal.pone.0022650.g001  Figure 1   Example of a communicative signal trial.  Agent A points to an object to be picked up; agent B bends down and picks it up. B was presented using limited-lifetime technique (6 signal dots) and masked with temporally scrambled noise dots. The noise level displayed is the minimum allowed in the experiment (5 noise dots). To provide a static depiction of the animated sequence, dots extracted from 3 different frames are superimposed and simultaneously represented; the silhouette depicting the human form was not visible in the stimulus display.     Participants were instructed to look at each stimulus and to decide whether it was a signal trial or a noise trial. Responses were given by pressing one of two keys on a keyboard. Participants were informed that there were two conditions (Individual vs. Communicative) and that, in the Communicative condition, the actions of A and B were semantically related. This was meant to ensure that participants devoted proper attention to agent A's actions in both conditions. In order to minimize response bias, participants were also informed that the probability of signal or noise was the same in both conditions. Each participant completed four 30-trial blocks: 10 actions (5 communicative+5 individual) by 2 types of trial (signal or noise) by 6 repetitions. Each block consisted of (signal and noise) trials of both conditions presented in randomized order. Blocks lasted approximately seven minutes each and were separated by a rest period of two minutes. Accuracy feedback was provided after each block.    Training session  Stimuli consisted in five actions performed by a single agent, masked with five levels of noise (5, 15, 25, 35 or 45 noise dots). Training actions were selected from the CID and included ‘raising arms’, ‘doing aerobics’, ‘picking something up’, ‘standing up’ and ‘turning’. Each participant completed four blocks of 25 trials (five actions by five noise levels and by two kinds of trials –signal/noise – by two repetitions). Trials in each block were presented in randomized order. Individual noise levels were determined by fitting a cumulative Gaussian function to the proportion of correct responses and determining the 75% threshold. The minimum noise level allowed was five noise dots. Individual noise levels determined in the preliminary session ranged from 5 to 26 dots (M = 8.7, SD = 6.2).    Data Analysis  Following administration, each response was coded as correct or incorrect. For both the Communicative and the Individual condition, a correct response was scored for a “yes” response on signal trials and for a “no” response on noise trials. In order to compare performance in the Communicative and Individual condition, we also extracted Signal Detection Theory parameters. For each participant we calculated the number of hits (“signal” responses on signal trials) and false alarms (“signal” responses on noise trials) in the two experimental conditions. For each condition, the hit rate (H) was calculated by dividing the number of hits by the total number of signal trials (N = 30), and the false alarm rate (F) was calculated by dividing the number of false alarms by the total number of noise trials (N = 30). Following the standard procedure, rates of 0 were replaced with 0.5/N, and rates of 1 were replaced with (N−0.5)/ N, where N is the number of signal or noise trials [19] . Criterion (c) and sensitivity (d′) parameters were extracted as follows [16] : where the function z is the inverse of the normal distribution function.     Experiment 2   Participants  Thirty-three undergraduate and graduate students from the University of Turin (8 male and 25 female, mean age = 20.4 years, age range 18–29) volunteered to take part in the experiment. All had normal or corrected-to-normal vision, had provided informed consent and were naïve with respect to the purpose of the study. None of Experiment 2 participants had participated in Experiment 1. The study was approved by the Ethical Committee of the Faculty of Psychology of the University of Turin and was conducted in accordance with the ethical standards laid down in the 1964 Declaration of Helsinki.    Stimuli  Stimuli consisted of two point-light figures, and belonged to 3 experimental conditions:    Communicative-congruent condition . As in Experiment 1, stimuli displayed a communicative interaction between two agents, with agent A performing a communicative gesture towards agent B, who responded accordingly (e.g., A asks B to squat down, B squats down).    Communicative-incongruent condition . Stimuli were assembled by replacing agent A's communicative action with a different communicative action executed with the same timing (communicative incongruent actions selected from the CID: ‘Come closer’, ‘Imitate me’, ‘Move it’, ‘Move over’, and ‘No’). As a result, B's response did not match A's request(e.g., A asks B to come closer, B squats down).    Individual condition . As in Experiment 1, stimuli were assembled by replacing agent A's communicative action with a non-communicative action executed with the same timing (e.g., A turns around, B squats down).      Apparatus and procedure  Apparatus, procedure, and data analysis were the same as in Experiment 1. Participants were informed that stimuli could be communicative or individual; they were further told that, in the Communicative conditions, the actions of A and B might or might not be semantically related. Participants completed four blocks of 45 trials: 15 actions (5 Communicative-congruent+5 Communicative-incongruent+5 Individual) by 2 types of trial (signal or noise) by 6 repetitions.    Post-experiment questionnaire  After the experimental session, participants were shown each stimulus again and asked to indicate a) whether the action of agent A was communicative or individual, and b) whether agent B was present or not. When participants reported the presence of agent B, they were asked to specify whether they a) had been guessing, b) had seen a human figure (or some of its body parts) but did not understand what she was doing, or c) had seen a human figure performing a specific action.      Results and Discussion   Experiment 1  The mean proportion of correct answers was .71 (score range = .53–.97), suggesting that the threshold estimate calculated in the training session had been sufficiently accurate for most of participants (Communicative condition: M  = .72, score range = .55–.95; Individual condition: M  = .71, score range = .53–.97). The “Pick it up” action was the most difficult to detect ( M  = .63), followed by “Squat down” ( M  = .70), “Look at that-ceiling” ( M  = .71), and “Help yourself” ( M  = .74). The most easily detected action was “Sit down” ( M  = .79).  In both the Communicative and the Individual condition, participants displayed a conservative detection threshold, as indicated by the positive mean values of c. Criterion values ranged from −.80 to 1.31 ( M  = .20; SD  = .43) in the Communicative condition and from −.64 to 1.44 ( M  = .35; SD  = .45) in the Individual condition. Sensitivity values ranged from .26 to 3.36 ( M  = 1.34; SD  = .83) in the Communicative condition and from .17 to 3.80 ( M  = 1.41; SD  = 1) in the Individual condition ( Figure 2 ). Within-subjects ANOVA revealed that, in the Communicative condition, the response criterion was significantly lower than in the Individual condition ( F (1,22)  = 9.55; p  = .005; Figure 2a ). No significant difference in sensitivity was found ( F (1,22)  = .43; p  = .517; Figure 2b ).   10.1371/journal.pone.0022650.g002  Figure 2   SDT parameters for the two experimental conditions.  Error bars are 95% confidence intervals.       Experiment 2  The mean proportion of correct responses was .76 (score range = .48–.92). The “Pick it up” action was the most difficult to detect ( M  = .69), followed by “Help yourself” ( M  = .75), “Look at that ceiling” ( M  = .77), and “Squat down” ( M  = .79). The most easily detected action was “Sit down” ( M  = .80). For each participant we extracted criterion ( c ) and sensitivity ( d′ ) parameters in the three experimental conditions. In all conditions participants showed a conservative detection threshold, as indicated by the positive mean values of the criterion parameter c . Criterion values ranged from −.62 to .93 ( M  = .07; SD  = .34) in the Communicative-congruent condition, from −.70 to 1.23 ( M  = .20; SD  = .45) in the Communicative-incongruent condition, and from −.61 to 1.05 ( M  = .24; SD  = .47) in the Individual condition. Sensitivity values ranged from .73 to 2.95 ( M  = 1.59; SD  = .58) in the Communicative-congruent condition, from −.08 to 3.09 ( M  = 1.73; SD  = .66) in the Communicative-incongruent condition, and from −.09 to 2.68 ( M  = 1.55; SD  = .68) in the Individual condition ( Figure 3 ).   10.1371/journal.pone.0022650.g003  Figure 3   SDT parameters for the three experimental conditions.  Error bars are 95% confidence intervals.     In order to compare criterion and sensitivity among the three experimental conditions we performed separate ANOVAs with condition (Communicative-congruent, Communicative-incongruent, and Individual) as the within-subject factor. For the criterion parameter, ANOVA revealed a significant effect of condition ( F 2,64)  = 7.08; p  = .002), with c linearly decreasing from the Communicative-congruent condition to the Communicative-incongruent condition to the Individual condition (linear contrast: F (1,32)  = 15.33; p <.001; Figure 3a ). Post-hoc comparisons (with Bonferroni correction) revealed that c was significantly lower in the Communicative-congruent condition compared to both the Communicative-incongruent condition ( p  = .034) and the Individual condition ( p  = .001). No significant difference between the Communicative-incongruent condition and the Individual condition was found ( p  = 1.000). For the sensitivity parameter, no significant effect was found in the ANOVA ( F (2,64)  = 2.12; p  = .128). Furthermore, post-hoc comparisons revealed no significant difference between the three experimental conditions ( p s ranging from .185 to 1.000; see Figure 3b ).  In the post-experiment questionnaire, participants were accurate in distinguishing between Communicative and Individual stimuli; the mean proportion of correct responses was .82 (Communicative-congruent = .81; Communicative-incongruent = .81; Individual = .83). Communicative-congruent and Communicative-incongruent stimuli were classified as communicative equally often ( t (32)  = −.08, p  = .931). Concerning agent B detection, the proportion of correct responses was .76. False alarms (i.e., signal reported when no signal was present; n = 105) amounted to 45% of the total errors, and were evenly distributed across experimental conditions. The great majority of participants committing false alarms reported having seen a human figure performing a specific action (44% of the false alarms), or having seen a human figure (or some of its body parts) performing an action they could not understand (52% of false alarms). Only a negligible percentage of participants reported guessing (4% of false alarms).  It is worth noticing that, even though no significant difference in criterion was found between the Communicative-incongruent condition and the Individual condition, the response criterion showed a significant linear decrease, being highest in the Individual condition, lower in the Communicative-incongruent condition, and lowest in the Communicative-congruent condition. This finding is consistent with a number of possible explanations. For example, it is possible that response bias made a minor contribution to changes in c ; also, this pattern of results may reflect the combination of two perceptual effects: a specific effect (B's action is predicted based on A's communicative action) and a generic effect (the presence, but not the specific action, of B is predicted based on the communicative nature of A's action). Future studies will be necessary to decide between these different explanations. First, functional MRI studies may help disentangling perceptual and non-perceptual aspects in the second-agent effect. Perception of biological motion has been consistently related to regions along the superior temporal sulcus, the motion-sensitive region MT, the parietal cortex, and other regions in visual cortex [20] , [21] , as well as to premotor areas in frontal cortex [22] . If the second agent effect is perceptual in nature, lowering of criterion in the communicative condition might be expected to modulate activity within these regions. Second, experiments in which both agents are masked and participants are not aware that they will observe communicative actions might help clarifying to what extent conscious attribution of communicative intention is necessary to produce a second-agent effect.    General Discussion  Previous research has shown that people can accurately distinguish between communicative and individual actions under point-light conditions [14] and that observing a communicative gesture improves detection of the presence of a second agent [5] . In this study, we demonstrated for the first time that information extracted from communicative gestures influences the concurrent processing of biological motion by prompting perception of a second agent, regardless of whether a second agent was in fact present or not (second-agent effect). This effect does not merely depend on observing a generic action performed by another agent (as we found reliable differences between the Communicative and Individual condition), nor on the observation of a communicative gesture per se (as we found differences between the Communicative-congruent and Communicative-incongruent condition). Rather, the results point to a specific effect based on interpersonal predictive coding, i.e. perception of the communicative gesture of one agent is used to predict the other agent's action (creating prior expectations concerning the presence of the second agent).  Perception of others' action is not simply a post-hoc reconstruction of the visual input, but an intrinsically predictive activity [23] . Predicting what kind of actions others will perform, as well as when and where others will act is essential for successful interaction [24] . If humans merely reacted to what they saw others doing, they could not anticipate their goals and intentions. Most importantly, they could never achieve the smooth and fast coordination needed to actively and directly online interact with others [25] .  The second agent effect provides a notable demonstration of the impact that prior expectations can have on the processing of others' actions in social contexts: expectations derived from interpersonal predictive coding can be so strong as to generate the illusion to see an agent even when no such agent is in fact present, a sort of “Bayesian ghost.”      Special thanks to Ben Schouten for his important contribution to design and implementation of the study.

Libertarians are an increasingly prominent ideological group in U.S. politics, yet they have been largely unstudied. Across 16 measures in a large web-based sample that included 11,994 self-identified libertarians, we sought to understand the moral and psychological characteristics of self-described libertarians. Based on an intuitionist view of moral judgment, we focused on the underlying affective and cognitive dispositions that accompany this unique worldview. Compared to self-identified liberals and conservatives, libertarians showed 1) stronger endorsement of individual liberty as their foremost guiding principle, and weaker endorsement of all other moral principles; 2) a relatively cerebral as opposed to emotional cognitive style; and 3) lower interdependence and social relatedness. As predicted by intuitionist theories concerning the origins of moral reasoning, libertarian values showed convergent relationships with libertarian emotional dispositions and social preferences. Our findings add to a growing recognition of the role of personality differences in the organization of political attitudes.   During the time the study was completed, general funding for the first author was provided by The John Templeton Foundation http://www.templeton.org/ ), Siemer and Associates ( http://www.siemer.com/ ), and an Oakley Fellowship from University of Southern California ( http://www.usc.edu ). The funders had no role in study design, data collection and analysis, decision to publish, or preparation of the manuscript.    info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0042366.g006   Introduction    “Civilization is the process of setting man free from men.”   - Ayn Rand (1944)   Political psychologists have learned a great deal about the psychological differences between liberals and conservatives [1] – [4] , but very little is known about the psychological characteristics of libertarians, who are sometimes described as being conservative on economic issues (e.g., against government regulation of free markets) but liberal on social issues (e.g., against government intrusion into private matters like sex or drug use). In the United States, libertarians appear to be rising in both numbers [5] and prominence in national politics [6] . The presidential candidacies of Texas Congressman Ron Paul in 2008 and 2012 and the 2009 birth of the “Tea Party” movement have greatly elevated the visibility and importance of libertarian ideas about individual liberty and the importance of limited government. Many “Tea Party” members are actually socially conservative [7] , but emphasize ideas about limited government that reflect libertarian principles. In this paper, we document libertarian moral psychology, which, as we show, is distinct from both liberal and conservative moralities. We use this unique group to illustrate how psychological dispositions predispose individuals to endorse particular values and choose coherent ideological identifications, consistent with current models of moral intuitionism [8] , ideological choice [9] , and the moralization of preferences [10] .   Beyond the Bipolar View of Political Personality  The “culture war” fought out in American public and political life since the 1980s has often been described in binary terms as a conflict between two visions of morality and moral authority [11] , [12] . On the right, the conservative side has insisted that there is an objective moral truth. Traditional institutions are seen as embodying the wisdom of the ages, and therefore closely reflecting this moral truth. On the left, the liberal side has insisted that moral truth is not fixed for all time, but is a work in progress, to be reinterpreted toward the goal of promoting greater well-being for all [11] – [13] . Psychologists have been able to measure these differences in moral judgment [3] along with their underlying personality correlates. For example, political conservativism has been found to be associated with greater tolerance of inequality, and lesser tolerance of change [4] , greater conscientiousness [1] , and greater sensitivity to disgust [14] . Political liberals, on the other hand, tend to be more open than conservatives to new experiences [1] and more empathic [15] . This research has been an important first step in understanding the ideology-personality relation, and the psychological organization of political attitudes. Rozin [16] highlighted the importance of identifying real-world invariance in meaningful parts of life, for which political ideology certainly qualifies.  Yet within research on ideology, libertarianism—with its mix of liberal and conservative sensibilities—has gone largely unstudied. Libertarian ideology prescribes a unique pattern of moral concerns that cannot be readily classified on the standard left-right dimension, but as with differences between liberals and conservatives, these unique sensibilities should be measurable using existing psychological scales. In this paper, we empirically address the question of what dispositional traits, emotions, and social preferences predict self-identification as libertarian. Based on the stated beliefs of libertarian intellectual leaders, as well as previous research on the social and intuitive origins of moral beliefs [17] , we generate three broad expectations about libertarian psychology and evaluate them in a large dataset, across a variety of psychological characteristics. In addition to providing a detailed empirical description of the distinct moral-psychological profile of individuals who self-identify as libertarians in the US context, we examine the relations between their dispositional traits, values, and social preferences allowing us more general insight into the origins of moral judgment, which can then be applied to any group with this distinct psychological profile.    Libertarian Ideology  Modern libertarians are attitudinally diverse, but all types of libertarianism trace their origins back to the enlightenment thinkers of the 17 th and 18 th century who argued that states, laws, and governments exist for the benefit of the people. The individual is the unit of value, and the liberty of the individual is the essential precondition for human flourishing. John Locke wrote: “the great and chief end, therefore, of men's uniting into commonwealths and putting themselves under government is the preservation of their property” ( [18] - Para 123). Locke had an expansive notion of property, which included men's “lives, liberties, and estates.” His ideas were later paraphrased into one of the most famous phrases in the Declaration of Independence: “life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.”  Libertarianism has historically rejected the idea that the needs of one person impose a moral duty upon others. This is one of the major points on which liberals and libertarians diverged in the 20 th century. Libertarianism stayed close to Locke's and Mill's notions of liberty as freedom from interference, which the philosopher Isaiah Berlin [19] later called “negative liberty.” But beginning in the progressive era of the late 19 th century, the American left began to adopt European ideas about the conditions and entitlements that people need to make the most of their liberty. Government action came to be seen as essential for ensuring “positive liberty” by providing the social conditions – such as education, health care, and financial security – that give people the freedom to pursue their own happiness.  Seen in this light it becomes clear why American libertarians are sometimes called “classical liberals,” and in Europe, the term liberal is often used in the same way that “classical liberal” is used in the United States. It also becomes clear why libertarian thought is now associated with anti-government and anti-progressive movements. Libertarianism provides an ideological narrative whereby the opposition to high taxes and big government is not just an “economic” position: it is a moral position as well. This narrative provides the basis for principled opposition to a government seen as unfair (because it takes from the productive and gives to the unproductive), tyrannical (because it violates the negative liberty of some people to promote the positive liberty of others), and wasteful (because governments rarely achieve the efficiencies generated by the competition of private firms).    The Psychological Roots of the Libertarian Ideology  The most obvious psychological characteristic of libertarian ideology is the value placed on negative liberty as an overriding moral principle, as can be seen in this quote concerning a law outlawing online gambling, from U.S. Congressman Ron Paul [20] , the most libertarian contender in recent times for the nomination of a major political party:   The most basic principle to being a free American is the notion that we as individuals are responsible for our own lives and decisions. We do not have the right to rob our neighbors to make up for our mistakes, neither does our neighbor have any right to tell us how to live, so long as we aren't infringing on their rights…. There are those that feel online gambling is morally wrong and financially irresponsible, which I do not argue with, but they also feel that because of this, the government should step in and prevent or punish people for taking part in these activities. This attitude is anathema to the ideas of liberty.   Libertarians appear to have a coherent moral philosophy, which includes a general opposition to forcing any particular moral code upon others. Note that Paul is not saying that gambling is morally acceptable. Rather, he is saying that (negative) liberty has a moral value that supersedes other moral considerations. Libertarians seem willing to reject both liberal concerns for social justice [21] and conservative concerns for respecting existing social structure [22] when those concerns conflict with their superordinate interest in maintaining individual liberty. The goal of our first study is to confirm these observations by directly surveying a broad range of moral values and concerns, and testing whether self-described libertarians place a higher value on liberty and a lower value on other moral concerns, compared to self-described liberals and conservatives.  But what might explain the libertarian focus on liberty to the exclusion of other moral concerns? Recent work in moral psychology suggests that moral attitudes arise, at least in part, from low-level “dispositional traits” [23] , emotional reactions [8] , [24] , social function [17] , and the moralization of preferences [10] . These moral attitudes have, in turn, been found to be associated with ideological self-identification [3] , [9] .  This work suggests that one explanation for the unique moral profile of libertarians is that they feel traditional moral concerns less than do most other people. Tetlock, et al. [25] found that libertarians were less morally outraged by “taboo” moral tradeoffs (e.g., buying and selling body parts for transplantation) than were liberals, conservatives, or socialists. Recent research in moral psychology has emphasized the importance of intuitive and emotional reactions in producing moral judgments that appear, on their face, to be based on principled reasoning [8] , [24] , [26] . Might libertarians be more tolerant on issues of private consensual behavior than conservatives because they exhibit lower levels of disgust sensitivity [27] ? Might libertarians depart from liberals on social justice issues because they have weaker feelings of empathy [15] ? Indeed, libertarian writers have historically been proud of the rational — rather than emotional — roots of their ideology [28] . The possible exception to this rule, of course, is the vigorous reaction libertarians often have to violations of personal freedom. Libertarians' characteristic pattern of emotional reactions (and lack thereof) may constrain the types of concerns that they moralize, which in turn affects their attraction to libertarian self-identification. We investigate this possibility in Study 2.  Finally, emotional reactions, and the moral principles that derive from them, serve interpersonal functions [17] , [29] , such as navigating the social world [30] and forming groups with others [31] . Libertarians may have a dispositional preference for independence, perhaps even for solitude, and therefore less use for moral principles that bind them to others. In The Fountainhead , Ayn Rand [32] writes about the importance of maintaining one's individuality within social relationships. Do libertarians identify less with the people in their lives, with groups, and with their nations? Do they derive less enjoyment from the company of others? This relative preference for individualism may gradually become moralized into a conscious endorsement of liberty as a moral principle [10] , predisposing them to a libertarian self-identification. We investigate these possibilities in Study 3.    The Current Research  In this paper, we let libertarians speak for themselves. We report the results of 16 surveys in which a total of 11,994 self-identified libertarians participated. We show how self-described libertarians differ from self-described liberals and conservatives not just on their moral beliefs, but on a variety of personality measures that, given previous research on the emotional [8] , [30] and social origins of moral reasoning [17] , [29] , [33] , help us to understand why libertarians may hold their unique pattern of moral beliefs.  Our goal, however, was not just to describe the moral intuitions and dispositional traits of libertarians. Our second goal was to provide further evidence for the dispositional origins of ideology [1] , [9] , the role of intuition in moral attitudes [8] , and the role that social functioning plays in moral thinking [17] , [29] , [33] . More specifically, we sought to replicate tests of a predictive model of ideological identification [9] that is similar to McAdams' framework of personality. McAdams' [34] , [35] three-level account of personality posits that the lowest level consists of global, decontextualized “dispositional traits,” such as the Big 5 or disgust sensitivity. Level 2 refers to a person's “characteristic adaptations” such as values, goals attachment styles, and defense mechanisms. McAdams' third level consists of “integrative life stories,” which are the idiosyncratic stories that people tell themselves about themselves. These stories often weave the level 1 and level 2 constructs into narratives that help people understand and justify their particular moral values. Haidt, Graham, and Joseph [36] modified McAdams' third level for work in political psychology by pointing out that not all of these stories are self-constructed. We do not explicitly examine integrative narratives in this study, but when one gravitates toward an existing political party or ideology, one takes on many of the ideological narratives that have been laboriously constructed over decades by authors such as Ayn Rand (who, not coincidentally, put most of her political philosophy into narrative form in her novels).  To apply this model to the study of libertarians, we first show that libertarians do indeed have a distinct profile of moral concerns (Study 1). We then show that dispositional traits relate to ideological identification, and that this relationship is often mediated by moral intuitions, which can be thought of as a type of characteristic adaptation in McAdams' terminology (Study 2). In Study 3, we show that specific moral concerns relate to distinct styles of social functioning, and that libertarians' unique moral profile relates to their social preferences. Consistent with theories of parallel constraint satisfaction [37] , we show that libertarianism can be understood as a set of relationships between a broad number of dispositional traits, social preferences, and moral values.  We begin with three general predictions.    Libertarians will value liberty more strongly and consistently than liberals or conservatives, at the expense of other moral concerns. This expectation is based on the explicit writings of libertarian authors (e.g. the Libertarian party website at lp.org, with the title “The Party of Principle: Minimum Government, Maximum Freedom”).    Libertarians will rely upon emotion less – and reason more – than will either liberals or conservatives . This expectation is based upon previous research on the affective origins of moral judgment [8] , as well as libertarians' own self-characterizations. For example, one of the main libertarian magazines is called, simply, Reason .    Libertarians will be more individualistic and less collectivist compared to both liberals and conservatives . This expectation is based upon previous research concerning the social function of moral judgment [17] , [29] , [33] . Libertarians often refer to the “right to be left alone” [38] , and show strong reactance toward social or legal pressures to join groups or assume obligations toward others that are not freely chosen [39] .    We evaluate these predictions in three studies using large web-based samples and a variety of measures related to morality, cognition, emotion, and social relatedness. Each “study” is actually a collection of separate studies that were conducted via a data collection website (described below), but for presentation purposes, we group them together based on the predictions they address.     Methods   Participants and Sampling Considerations  The analyses presented are based on data from 157,804 participants (45.6% female, median age = 34) who visited YourMorals.org and participated in one or more studies between June 2007 and January 2011. Results replicate within sub-samples collected before and after January 2010, indicating that the findings of this paper were not greatly affected by current events that occurred during data collection. Only participants who were raised in the United States until at least the age of 14 were included in these analyses. YourMorals.org is a data collection platform where, after providing basic demographics, participants are invited to take part in any of 6–8 featured and 30–40 overall studies, each described with a title and a brief one sentence description. Before each study, participants were presented with an IRB approved information sheet, detailing our contact information, participant rights, and study details, to which they were asked to agree. Upon completion of each scale, a graph including the participant's own score in comparison to others is provided. Participants usually find YourMorals.org through publicity about psychological research or by typing keywords related to morality into a search engine. Most participants took one or two surveys, but 37% completed more than two, and 15% completed more than five.  YourMorals.org offers a unique opportunity to examine libertarian morality because, unlike most major surveys (e.g., Gallup, ANES), it allows participants to choose the label “libertarian” as a self-descriptor, rather than forcing them to select a point on the liberal-conservative spectrum. As of January 2011, 11,994 American visitors to YourMorals.org had self-identified as “libertarian”. Because our sample is not representative, we do not claim to describe the absolute percentage of libertarians who hold any particular belief or share any particular trait. Rather, our goal is to compare libertarians to liberals and conservatives on a variety of personality traits, in order to examine whether the relationships found between dispositions, values, and social functioning in previous research are also found within self-described libertarians.    Overall Design  Our main dependent variable is political self-identification, which we use to compare ideological groups within each specific study. Upon registration, participants were asked “When it comes to politics, do you usually think of yourself as liberal, moderate, conservative, or something else?” Options available on a dropdown menu included “very liberal,” “liberal,” “slightly liberal,” “moderate/middle of the road,” “slightly conservative,” “conservative,” “very conservative,” “don't know/not political”, “libertarian,” and “other.” The libertarian option was chosen by 7.6% (N = 11,994) of American visitors; 13.5% (N = 21,278) chose one of the three conservative options, 11.1% (N = 17,541) chose “moderate,” while the majority (61.5%, N = 97,021) chose one of the three liberal options.  Examining libertarians' responses on social versus economic issues indicated that our participants' understanding of the term “libertarian” converged with our expectations that they would be fiscally conservative and socially liberal. When asked “how liberal or conservative” they were on “economic issues” on a 1 (very liberal) to 7 (very conservative) scale, libertarians indicated that they were even more conservative (M = 6.10) than conservatives (M = 5.93), and far more conservative than liberals (M = 2.83). When asked the same question about “social issues”, libertarians characterized themselves as much more liberal than self-identified conservatives (M's = 2.49 vs. 5.16), though not as liberal as liberals themselves (M = 1.66). Self-identified libertarians in our sample also reported specific political attitudes that were consistent with the expected pattern of relative social liberalism. For example, 59% of libertarians felt that “abortion should be generally available to those who want it” compared with 18% of conservatives, and 69% of libertarians felt “same sex couples should be allowed to legally marry” compared with 21% of conservatives (the comparable percentages for self-identified liberals were 84% for abortion and 92% for gay marriage). Parallel analyses using social liberalism combined with fiscal conservatism as a proxy for libertarianism in this sample replicated the main findings of this paper. Analysis of the values of a statistically extracted cluster (see Table 1 ) also replicates the general pattern found using self-identification. However, we report results for those who self-categorized as libertarian, as we believe that self-categorization is a significant psychological step that corresponds to how libertarianism is used in American political discourse (e.g. the libertarian party is an active third party).  10.1371/journal.pone.0042366.t001 Table 1  Description of Three Groups from Study 1 Cluster Analysis.

The full libertarian sample was mostly white (87.5% of those who answered our ethnicity question), male (79.6%), well educated (79.3% were in college or had earned a college degree), and diverse on age (mean age = 34.88, SD = 13.1). Libertarians were comparable to other participants in terms of education, ethnicity, and age, but were much more likely to be male (79.6%) compared to both liberals (50.6% male) and conservatives (63.0% male). Because of this difference and because many of the distinguishing characteristics of libertarians turn out to be traits on which there are substantial gender differences, we include tables that show the effects separately for males and females.  Due to our large sample sizes and the many differences between liberals and conservatives, virtually all measures produced highly significant contrasts. Because the degree of significance is not as important as the overall pattern of differences, we do not discuss p values in the text, though they are indicated in Tables 2 , 3 , and 4 . Differences are shown as Cohen's d scores in these tables to allow comparisons of effect sizes across scales and genders. Any time we say that one group scored higher or lower than another group, the difference was significant at p <.01, and usually at p <.001. In describing our effects, we generally follow Cohen's [40] classification of effect sizes as small/slightly ( d  = .10 to .39), medium/moderately ( d  = .40 to .69), or large/substantially ( d >.70), but give the exact d statistic when differences are very small or very large. Rather than describing each measure in a single method section, we provide a short description of each scale and its sample, followed by the results for that scale, and a brief discussion of how the results help us evaluate our three predictions. Finally, after each set of measures, many of which have a great deal of psychological overlap, we include multivariate analyses designed to help the reader synthesize each set of measures presented.  10.1371/journal.pone.0042366.t002 Table 2  Means and Cohen's d-scores for measures in Study 1.

Results and Discussion   Study 1: Describing Libertarian Morality    If any civilization is to survive, it is the morality of altruism that men have to reject.    - Ayn Rand    Our first prediction was that, compared to liberals and conservatives, the morality of libertarians would be characterized by strong endorsement of individual liberty at the expense of other moral considerations. We addressed this question by examining several measures designed to give a broad overview of a person's values and morals, in particular the Moral Foundations Questionnaire [41] , and the Schwartz Value Scale [42] , as well as a new measure of endorsement of liberty as a moral principle, introduced here (see Appendix S1 ). For convergent validity, we also examined several other scales commonly used to measure moral orientations.    Moral Foundations Questionnaire  The Moral Foundations Questionnaire (MFQ) measures the degree to which a person relies on each of five moral foundations: harm/care, fairness/reciprocity, ingroup/loyalty, authority/respect, and purity/sanctity. The scale has two parts. The first measures abstract assessments of moral relevance (e.g., “When you decide whether something is right or wrong, to what extent do you consider whether or not someone suffered emotionally?” for harm) and the second measures agreement with more specific moral statements (e.g., “I would call some acts wrong on the grounds that they are unnatural,” for purity). The MFQ has been shown to be reliable and valid, and to predict a variety of moral and political attitudes, independent of political ideology [41] . The MFQ was completed by 97,036 participants (54,068 men; 64,109 liberals, 13,537 conservatives, and 8,539 libertarians). The number of participants given in each section includes only those participants who self-identified as liberal, conservative, or libertarian.   Results  The first five rows of Table 2 show d scores indicating how libertarians differed from liberals and conservatives on the MFQ (also see Figure 1 ). Libertarians were similar to conservatives on the fairness foundation, as both groups scored substantially lower than liberals. However, like liberals, libertarians scored substantially lower on the ingroup, authority, and purity foundations compared to conservatives. Finally, libertarians scored slightly lower than conservatives and substantially lower than liberals on the harm foundation. Convergent results were found using the Moral Foundations Sacredness Scale, which measures endorsement of foundations using a willingness to make tradeoffs.   10.1371/journal.pone.0042366.g001  Figure 1   Libertarians have weaker intuitions about most moral concerns, but stronger intuitions about liberty.       Interpretation  Our results suggest why libertarians do not feel fully at home in either of the major American political parties. Consistent with our prediction, libertarians were relatively low on all five foundations. Libertarians share with liberals, a distaste for the morality of ingroup, authority, and purity, characteristic of social conservatives, particularly those on the religious right [43] . Like liberals, libertarians can be said to have a two-foundation morality, prioritizing harm and fairness above the other three foundations. But libertarians share with conservatives their moderate scores on these two foundations. They are therefore likely to be less responsive than liberals to moral appeals from groups who claim to be victimized, oppressed, or treated unfairly. Libertarianism is clearly not just a point on the liberal-conservative continuum; libertarians have a unique pattern of moral concerns, with relatively low reliance on all five foundations.     Schwartz Values Scale  The SVS [42] consists of 58 statements of values. Participants rate the degree to which each value serves “as a guiding principle in his or her life,” using a 9-point scale running from “opposed to my values” to “of supreme importance.” The scale has been used widely in cross-cultural research (Schwartz et al., 2001). It produces composite scores for 10 values, which are shown in Table 2 . The SVS was completed by 10,071 participants (5,426 men; 6,518 liberals, 1,278 conservatives, and 1,213 libertarians).   Results  Table 2 shows that libertarians are similar to liberals on most values, scoring moderately higher than conservatives on hedonism and stimulation, and substantially lower than conservatives on conformity, security, and tradition. Libertarians also scored similarly to liberals and slightly lower than conservatives on power. Libertarians departed from liberals and joined conservatives on only one value: universalism, where libertarians were substantially lower than liberals. Libertarians were unique on two values: benevolence, where they scored moderately below the other two groups, and self-direction, where they scored the highest (slightly higher than liberals and moderately higher than conservatives).    Interpretation  Once again, we see that libertarians look somewhat like liberals, but assign lower importance to values related to the welfare or suffering of others–the benevolence value (which Schwartz defines as: “Preservation and enhancement of the welfare of people with whom one is in frequent personal contact”) and universalism (defined as “Understanding, appreciation, tolerance, and protection for the welfare of all people and for nature”). It is also noteworthy that the highest mean for any Schwartz Value dimension was libertarians' endorsement of self-direction (defined as “Independent thought and action – choosing, creating, exploring”). Self-Direction was the most strongly endorsed value for all three groups, but for libertarians the difference was quite large compared to the next most endorsed value, achievement ( d  = 1.04). If libertarians have indeed elevated self-direction as their foremost guiding principle, then they may see the needs and claims of others, whether based on liberal or conservative principles, as a threat to their primary value.     Ethics Position Questionnaire  The Ethics Position Questionnaire [44] is composed of two 10-item subscales measuring moral idealism and moral relativism. Idealism reflects the extent to which a concern for the welfare of others is at the heart of an individual's moral code (e.g. “People should make certain that their actions never intentionally harm another even to a small degree.”). Relativism concerns whether or not an individual believes that moral principles are universal (e.g. “What is ethical varies from one situation and society to another.”). The scale is commonly used in the business ethics literature and has been shown to predict immoral behavior in ethical situations [45] . The Ethics Position Questionnaire was completed by 8,078 participants (4,785 men; 4,991 liberals, 1,240 conservatives, and 1,001 libertarians).   Results  Table 2 shows that libertarians score moderately lower than liberals and slightly lower than conservatives on moral idealism. Libertarians score moderately higher than conservatives ( d  = .58), and similar but lower than liberals ( d  = −.25), on moral relativism.    Interpretation  According to Forsyth's [44] classification system, individuals who score high in relativism and low on idealism — the pattern found for libertarians — are labeled “subjectivists” who “reject moral rules” and “base moral judgments on personal feelings about the action and the setting.” Subjectivists have been found to be more lenient in judging individuals who violate moral norms [46] . This result is consistent with our findings on the MFQ and Schwartz Values Scale measures, in that libertarians appear to live in a world where traditional moral concerns (e.g., altruism, respect for authority) are not assigned much importance.     Good Self Scale  The Good-Self Assessment [47] is a measure of moral self-relevance, or the degree to which one sees moral, rather than non-moral, traits as part of his/her self-concept. This is a slightly modified version of the original; for the moral traits we replaced sincere and helpful with kind and loyal, and for the non-moral traits we replaced athletic and industrious with intellectual and hardworking. In this measure participants are given a list of 8 moral and 8 non-moral positive traits (each described with two synonymous terms, e.g. “honest or truthful”) and are asked to rate their importance to their self-concept from 1 = not important to 4 = extremely important. This scale was completed by 606 participants (294 men; 367 liberals, 85 conservatives, and 77 libertarians).   Results  Table 2 shows that libertarians scored moderately lower than liberals and substantially lower than conservatives on the self-relevance of moral traits. They did not differ from liberals and conservatives on the importance they ascribed to non-moral traits. We also examined the non-moral term, “independent”, separately, and found that liberals (d = −.38, p<.01) and conservatives (d = −.37, p<.05) scored significantly lower than libertarians.    Interpretation  The results suggest that libertarians are less likely to see moral traits as important to their core self, compared to liberals and conservatives. At the same time they are just as likely as these two groups to base their self-concept around positive non-moral characteristics, such as being funny or outgoing. Notably, libertarians were the only group to report valuing pragmatic, non-moral traits more than moral traits. Libertarians may hesitate to view traits that engender obligations to others (e.g. loyal, generous, sympathetic) as important parts of who they are because such traits imply being altruistic [48] .     Lifestyle and Economic/Government Liberty  In the original conception of Moral Foundations Theory, concerns about liberty (or autonomy or freedom) were not measured. But as we began to collect data on libertarians and to hear objections from libertarians that their core value was not well represented, we created questions related to liberty in the style of the Moral Foundations Questionnaire. We generated 11 items about several forms of liberty (see Appendix S1 ) and collected responses from 3,732 participants (2,105 men; 2,181 liberals, 573 conservatives, and 525 libertarians). Principal component analysis using varimax rotation indicated two clear factors (Eigenvalues of 3.40 and 1.48; next highest was .74). Six items loaded greater than .60 on the first factor, which represented concerns about economic/government liberty (e.g., “People who are successful in business have a right to enjoy their wealth as they see fit”). Three items loaded greater than .60 on the second factor, which can be interpreted as a “lifestyle liberty” factor (e.g., “Everyone should be free to do as they choose, as long as they don't infringe upon the equal freedom of others.”). We created two subscales from these items (Cronbach's alpha for economic/government liberty was .81; for lifestyle liberty, .60; the correlation between factors was .27).   Results  Table 2 shows that libertarians scored highest on both kinds of liberty (also see Figure 1 ). On economic/government liberty, liberals were the outliers, scoring below the midpoint of the scale, two full standard deviations below libertarians ( d  = 2.56). On lifestyle liberty, libertarians scored substantially higher than both liberals ( d  = .81), and conservatives ( d  = 1.19).    Interpretation  Libertarians are not unconcerned about all aspects of morality, as suggested by their scores on the MFQ and several other widely used morality scales. Rather, consistent with their self-descriptions, they care about liberty. Like conservatives, they endorse a world in which people are left alone to enjoy the fruits of their own labor, free from government interference. They also exceed both liberals and conservatives (but are closer to liberals) in endorsing personal or lifestyle liberty.     Do libertarians have a unique moral profile?  We conducted two analyses to answer this question, in addition to the above comparisons. First, we conducted a cluster analysis of participants using Moral Foundations Questionnaire sub-scale scores, to see if we could statistically extract libertarians based on their pattern of responses concerning their values, rather than on their self-identification. Second, we conducted a principal components analysis of the measures included in Study 1 in order to see if the values that libertarians espouse did indeed form a coherent factor.   Cluster Analysis  A hierarchical cluster analysis was conducted on all participants who completed both the basic Moral Foundations Questionnaire sub-scale scores, as well as the Liberty Foundation scores (N = 3,094), using Ward's Method to calculate the distance between participants. Visual analysis of the resulting dendogram indicated that a major third cluster split occurs at a significant distance from further divisions, and we therefore classified all participants based on this three-cluster solution. Mean scores and the composition of each group are given in Table 1 . Group 1, in which 74% of participants self-identified as liberal, shows a high concern for harm, fairness, and lifestyle liberty. Group 2, in which a plurality (44%) self-identified as conservative, shows a more even distribution of concerns across all moral foundations. Group 3, in which 60% self-identified as libertarian, shows by far the highest concern for lifestyle and economic/government liberty, and the lowest level of concern on the five moral foundations.    Principal Components Analysis  Principal components analysis using all measures from Study 1, except for the Good-Self Scale, was conducted on 374 participants (214 liberals, 31 moderates, 31 conservatives, 72 libertarians, and 26 other/apolitical) who completed these measures. Scree plot analysis [49] indicated a 4 factor solution was appropriate, with only four factors having an eigenvalue greater than one. Four factors were extracted using varimax rotation, which we interpreted as conservative values (e.g. MFQ-purity), other-oriented values (e.g. MFQ-harm), self-oriented values (e.g. Schwartz Values-power), and liberty values (including measures of lifestyle liberty, economic/government liberty, and Schwartz Values-self direction). Table 5 lists all factor loadings greater than .10. Standardized factor scores were computed for each participant and analyzed across political groups ( Figure 2 ), indicating that libertarians are indeed characterized by liberty values, conservatives by conservative values, and liberals by other-oriented values. Convergent results were found with the Good Self Subscales included, with Moral Traits loading on other-oriented values and pragmatic traits loading on self-oriented values, but the sample size (N = 79) is below what is customary in factor analyses.   10.1371/journal.pone.0042366.g002  Figure 2   Libertarians are more concerned with liberty values and less concerned with other-oriented and conservative values.     10.1371/journal.pone.0042366.t005 Table 5  Principle Components Analysis Factor Loadings of Variables in Study 1.

Factor loadings >|.5| bolded.      Interpretation  The above analyses suggest that libertarians indeed hold an empirically distinct set of values, compared to liberals and conservatives. Given that liberty values form an empirically distinct value cluster that has pragmatic utility in differentiating groups and is distinct from other self-oriented concerns such as power and achievement, it is likely that concerns about liberty represent a moral intuition previously unmeasured in Moral Foundations Theory. A cluster analysis of participants yielded a 3-group solution where members of this third group endorsed libertarian values more and liberal/conservative values less, and were also more likely to be libertarian (see Table 1 ). Principal components analysis yields a distinct “liberty values” factor that meaningfully differentiates individuals. Patterns of endorsement across all four components indicate that libertarians have a moral profile that is clearly distinct from both liberals and conservatives (see Figure 2 ). Libertarians generally score over a half a standard deviation lower than liberals on variables which compose the “other-oriented values” factor and over a half a standard deviation lower than conservatives on variables which load on the “conservative values” factor (see Table 1 ). Libertarian scores are similar to those of liberals on “self-oriented values.” Finally, libertarians score higher than both liberals and conservatives on “liberty values.”     Study 1 Summary: What is Libertarian Morality?  Our results suggest that libertarians are a distinct group that places lower value on morality as typically measured by moral psychologists. This pattern was replicated across a variety of largely separate samples with moral concerns measured using several different approaches. Our measures were not overtly political in content, and there were few questions about the role of government. Rather, we used measures of general values and moral beliefs, and found that libertarians were consistently less concerned than other groups about the individual-level, other-oriented concerns that most theorists place at the heart of morality: harm, benevolence, and altruism. The contrast here was starkest with liberals, but we also found that libertarians were much less concerned than conservatives with group-level moral issues (e.g. conformity, loyalty, and tradition) that are typically associated with conservative morality [3] . Libertarians viewed commonly measured moral traits, but not pragmatic traits, as less essential to their self-concept.  This is not to say, however, that libertarians are devoid of moral concerns. Contemporary moral psychology has paid little attention to the valuation of negative liberty as a specifically moral concern. Independence may be seen as a pragmatic value [47] . Respecting the autonomy of others may be seen as a way to promote the welfare of individuals [43] , consistent with liberal ideas about positive liberty, rather than as an independent moral construct. It is predictable, then, that on such measures libertarians appear amoral (i.e. lacking in the activation of common moral systems). However, our results show that libertarians score substantially higher than liberals and conservatives on measures of both economic and lifestyle liberty, the Schwartz value of Self-Direction, and the centrality of independence to one's core self (measured using the Modified Good Self scale). Libertarians may fear that the moral concerns typically endorsed by liberals or conservatives (as measured by the MFQ) are claims that can be used to trample upon individual rights — libertarians' sacred value (e.g. [48] ). If liberty is included as a moral value, libertarians are not amoral. Rather, standard morality scales, including the Moral Foundations Questionnaire, do a poor job of measuring libertarian values.  Therefore, our first prediction was strongly supported: libertarians value liberty more strongly and consistently than liberals or conservatives, at the expense of other moral concerns. We now turn to the question of libertarian dispositions. In particular, might libertarians simply feel the emotional pull of most moral concerns more weakly than other people do? Might libertarians generally be dispositionally more rational and less emotional? Study 2 tests whether these dispositional traits (level 1) may lead libertarians to certain values (level 2) and then to the endorsement of certain ideological narratives (level 3), which tie these values together in the form of an ideology [9] .    Study 2: How Do Libertarians Think and Feel?    “Every aspect of Western culture needs a new code of ethics - a rational ethics - as a precondition of rebirth.”   - Ayn Rand  [50]   In Study 2, we sought to examine cognitive and emotional differences among libertarians, liberals, and conservatives. Psychologists have long theorized that values evolve from the interaction of heritable dispositions, childhood learning, and social-contextual factors [34] , [51] . We expected the libertarian dispositional profile to converge with the results of Study 1, in which libertarians showed a relative lack of concern for the most common moral considerations. Given the well-documented influence of emotions on moral judgment and behavior [24] , [52] – [54] , if it turns out that libertarians feel fewer or weaker moral emotions, then it is understandable that their morality would be substantially different from that of liberals and conservatives.  In place of a system of morality deriving from emotion, libertarians have explicitly sought a “rational ethics” [28] . Among the main traits that have been found to distinguish liberals from conservatives are those related to cognitive style. Liberals score higher on traits related to tolerance for ambiguity, need for cognition, and openness to experience [4] . Based on the explicitly intellectual focus of libertarian writing, and on their general lack of concern for tradition and traditional morality, we expected that libertarians would generally resemble liberals on such measures.  These considerations led us to our second prediction: Libertarians will reveal a cognitive style that depends less on emotion– and more on reason– than will either liberals or conservatives. We expected this cognitive style to relate to the distinct moral profile described in Study 1, leading to libertarian self-identification.    Big Five Personality Inventory  The Big Five Personality Inventory [55] is a 44-item measure of five personality traits often said to be the most fundamental traits in personality psychology: openness to experience, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism. The measure was completed by 29,043 participants (14,091 men; 19,106 liberals, 3,991 conservatives, and 2,615 libertarians).   Results  Table 3 shows that libertarians scored lower than the other two groups on agreeableness, conscientiousness, and extraversion. They scored low (similar to conservatives) on neuroticism, and they scored quite high (similar to liberals) on openness to experience.    Interpretation  The libertarian pattern on the Big 5 complements our findings on their explicit values in Study 1. Libertarians report lower levels of the traits that indicate an orientation toward engaging with and pleasing others (i.e., extraversion and agreeableness). Low scores on agreeableness in particular have been said to indicate a lack of compassion and a critical, skeptical nature [51] . In addition, as in Study 1, we see that libertarians share traits with liberals (high openness to experience) as well as conservatives (low neuroticism).     Interpersonal Reactivity Index  The Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI [56] ) is a 28-item measure of empathy, with 7 items covering each of four distinct aspects of empathic responding to others: 1) empathic concern for others, 2) fantasy, 3) personal distress, and 4) perspective-taking. Participants were asked whether certain statements did or did not characterize them very well (e.g. “I often have tender, concerned feelings for people less fortunate than me,” for empathic concern). The IRI was completed by 6,450 participants (3,073 men, 4,103 liberals, 906 conservatives, and 697 libertarians).   Results  Table 3 shows that libertarians scored moderately lower than conservatives and substantially lower than liberals on empathic concern for others (also see Figure 3 ). Libertarians score slightly lower than liberals and similar to conservatives on personal distress, perspective taking, and fantasy.   10.1371/journal.pone.0042366.g003  Figure 3   Libertarians report lower emotional responsiveness, but higher levels of psychological reactance.       Interpretation  According to Davis [56] , low levels of empathic concern indicate lower levels of sympathy and concern for unfortunate others, which may underlie libertarians' lower scores on the harm foundation of the MFQ, and their general rejection of altruism as a moral duty.     Disgust Scale  The Disgust Scale Revised [57] , [58] measures individual differences in the propensity to feel disgust toward three classes of elicitors: 1) core disgust (animals and body products that pose a microbial threat, such as rats, vomit, and dirty toilets); 2) animal-reminder disgust (corpses, gore, and other reminders that human bodies are mortal, like animal bodies); and 3) contamination (concerns about coming into physical contact with other people). The measure was completed by 32,738 participants (16,477 men; 23,516 liberals, 3,617 conservatives, and 2,368 libertarians).   Results  Table 3 shows that libertarians scored moderately lower than conservatives and slightly lower than liberals (also see Figure 3 ). However, the comparison to liberals appears to be driven by the fact that libertarians tend to be male and men tend to have lower levels of disgust sensitivity [57] . Within each gender, libertarians and liberals score similarly on the disgust scale. In contrast, libertarians score moderately lower than conservatives on measures of disgust within both genders (see Table 3 ) and across all three classes of disgust.    Interpretation  Previous research has shown that liberals are less disgust-sensitive than conservatives [14] . The low level of disgust sensitivity found in libertarians is consistent with previous research about the relationship between disgust and conservative attitudes on social issues, particularly those related to sexuality (e.g. MFQ-Purity in Study 1). Libertarians may not experience the flash of revulsion that drives moral condemnation in many cases of unorthodox behavior [59] .     Hong Reactance Scale  The Hong Reactance scale [60] is an 11-item measure of psychological reactance [61] . The scale measures the extent to which people are emotionally resistant to restrictions on their behavioral freedom and to the advice and influence of others. The measure was completed by 3,685 participants (1,777 men, 2,301 liberals, 510 conservatives, and 445 libertarians).   Results  Table 3 shows that libertarians score slightly higher than liberals and moderately higher than conservatives on psychological reactance (also see Figure 3 ).    Interpretation  The high levels of reactance expressed by libertarians fit well with the value they place on liberty as a moral foundation. It is of course possible that libertarians' responses to the scale are primarily expressions of their current political beliefs, but it is also possible that people who have the strongest visceral reactions to interference from others are also the people most drawn to the ideals and identity of libertarianism. Reactance may in fact function as a moral emotion that draws individuals toward the ideal of negative liberty. Reactance scores were negatively correlated with measures of empathy (Big Five Agreeableness: r = −.38, Baron-Cohen Empathizer: r = −.32, IRI Empathic Concern: r = −.15; p<.001 in all cases) that are most associated with conceptions of positive liberty [18] , which perhaps suggests why, in the US, libertarianism is more commonly associated with conservative, as opposed to liberal policies.     Empathizer-Systemizer Scale  The Empathizer-Systemizer scale (adapted from Baron-Cohen [62] ) measures the tendency to empathize, defined as “the drive to identify another person's emotions and thoughts, and to respond to these with an appropriate emotion” and to systemize, or “the drive to analyze the variables in a system, and to derive the underlying rules that govern the behavior of the system.” In short, empathizing is about understanding the social world whereas systemizing is about understanding the world of inanimate objects and nature. We selected 20 items from the full 40-item empathizer scale, and 20 items from the full 75-item systemizer scale to create a single survey that could be completed in less than 10 minutes. Cronbach's alphas for these measures were .80 (systemizer) and .84 (empathizer). The measure was completed by 8,870 participants (4,532 men, 6,525 liberals, 877 conservatives, and 637 libertarians).   Results  Table 3 shows that libertarians score the lowest of any group on empathizing, and the highest on systemizing (also see Figures 3 and 4 ). In fact, libertarians are the only group that scored higher on systemizing than on empathizing. Given that these traits are known to differ between men and women, it is important to examine these effects in each sex separately. Table 3 shows that the same effects hold when looking only at men, and when looking only at women.   10.1371/journal.pone.0042366.g004  Figure 4   Libertarians exhibit a reason-based cognitive style according to a variety of measures.       Interpretation  Research by Baron-Cohen [62] has shown that relatively high systemizing and low empathizing scores are characteristic of the male brain, with very extreme scores indicating autism. We might say that liberals have the most “feminine” cognitive style, and libertarians have the most “masculine.” These effects hold even when men and women are examined separately, as can be seen in Table 3 . Indeed, the “feminizing” of the Democratic party in the 1970s [63] may help explain why libertarians moved increasingly into the Republican party in the 1980s.     Need for Cognition  The Need for Cognition scale [64] is a measure of the extent to which people engage in and enjoy effortful cognitive activities. People with high need for cognition are more likely to form their attitudes by paying close attention to relevant arguments, whereas people with low need for cognition are more likely to rely on peripheral cues, such as how attractive or credible a speaker is. The measure was completed by 8,035 participants (4,242 men; 5,888 liberals, 760 conservatives, and 657 libertarians).   Results  Table 3 shows that libertarians scored slightly higher than liberals and moderately higher than conservatives on Need for Cognition (also see Figure 4 ).    Interpretation  This pattern is consistent with the libertarian valuation of logic and reasoning over emotion. Libertarians may enjoy thinking about complex and abstract systems more than other groups, particularly more than conservatives.     Moral Dilemmas  Six moral dilemmas adapted from Greene et. al. [24] were given to each participant. Each dilemma required a choice about whether to take an action to save multiple individuals at the cost of a single individual's life. Each dilemma was modified so that there was one more aversive version (e.g. “push this stranger off the bridge and onto the tracks below, where his large body will stop the trolley” – called “personal” in Greene et. al., [24] ) and one less aversive version (e.g. “hit the switch, which will cause the trolley to proceed to the right”). Participants were randomly assigned to receive one version of each dilemma; each participant received three aversive and three less aversive dilemmas. Below the dilemma text was the question “Is it morally appropriate for you to [do action] in order to [prevent some other danger]?” with a dichotomous No/Yes response option. These questions were followed by the question “How certain are you about your answer?” with a 7-point response scale from “extremely uncertain” to “extremely certain.” Participants' responses to the 12 dichotomous choice questions were weighted by certainty and then averaged, with higher scores indicating greater willingness to make utilitarian sacrifices. The measure was completed by 4,629 participants (2,615 men; 2,690 liberals, 765 conservatives, and 616 libertarians).   Results  Table 3 shows that libertarians were moderately more utilitarian than conservatives, and slightly more utilitarian than liberals (also see Figure 4 ). Their judgments were more utilitarian in both the more aversive and less aversive scenarios.    Interpretation  The results from these moral dilemmas, which are devoid of political content, indicate that libertarians are indeed more capable of “rational ethics” where costs and benefits are weighed according to utilitarian principles. Given the body of evidence suggesting that utilitarian judgments in these dilemmas are more likely to be reached via “cold” calculation, and that deontological (rights-based) judgments are more likely to be reached via “hot” affective processes (e.g., [24] , [65] ), our results suggests that libertarians are particularly unemotional in their moral deliberations.     Cognitive Reflection Task  The Cognitive Reflection Task [66] is a set of 3 logic questions that have correct and intuitive answers. Correct answers on these questions is said not just to measure intelligence, but also to measure a person's ability to suppress an intuitive response in service of the cognitive reasoning required to solve these problems. The measure was completed by 9,721 participants (4,971 men; 7,384 liberals, 1,267 conservatives, and 1,070 libertarians).   Results  Table 3 shows that libertarians find the correct answers to these questions at a slightly higher rate than liberals and moderately higher rate compared to conservatives (also see Figure 4 ).    Interpretation  The cognitive reflection task provides a behavioral validation of the hypothesis that libertarians have a more reasoned cognitive style. In our dataset, this measure inter-correlates with both Need for Cognition (r = .30, p<.001) and Baron-Cohen Systemizer (r = .31, p<.001) scores, with libertarians scoring higher than both liberals and conservatives on all three measures. Taken together, a convergent picture of the rational cognitive style of libertarians emerges ( Figure 4 ).     Do libertarian dispositions lead to libertarian values?  Consistent with McAdams' personality model [34] , previous research has found that dispositions predispose individuals to moralize specific concerns, which in turn constrain ideological choice [9] . We examined a model in which dispositional effects on ideological identification are mediated by value orientations, as measured by the Moral Foundations Questionnaire with questions concerning liberty added. This model has been previously found to be a superior fit to similar data, in comparison to alternative models [9] . Following the model previously used by Lewis & Bates [9] , we examined Individualizing (indicated by MFQ-Harm & Fairness) and Binding (indicated by MFQ-Ingroup, Authority, & Purity) values as related to disgust sensitivity and empathy, two key dispositional constructs identified in previous research as being related to these respective values [67] , [68] . We also included the lone positive dispositional explanation for the libertarian valuation of negative liberty (psychological reactance) to the Study 1 values most endorsed by libertarians (economic/government and lifestyle liberty). The dependent measure was a dichotomous variable, self-identification as libertarian.  Using AMOS 19, three structural equation models were created and compared: 1. a partial mediation model whereby dispositional variables affect libertarian self-identification directly as well as mediated by values (see Figure 5 ), 2. a full mediation model whereby dispositional variables could only affect libertarian self-identification by influencing values variables (the same model as Figure 5 , except that the paths connecting Disgust Sensitivity, Psychological Reactance, and Empathic Concern directly to libertarian self-identification were removed), and 3. an independence model whereby dispositional and values variables separately influence libertarian self-identification (the same model as Figure 5 , except that paths connecting Disgust Sensitivity to Binding values, Psychological Reactance to Liberty values, and Empathic Concern to Individualizing values, were all removed). Both the partial mediation (RMSEA = .044, Chi-Squared = 11028.75 (df = 36, p<.001), CFI = .94) and full mediation models (RMSEA = .042, Chi-Squared = 11062.75 (df = 39, p<.001), CFI = .94) were good fits to the data. Given our large sample size, the change in goodness of fit statistic is likely to be more diagnostic of model fit compared to statistics such as Chi-Squared [69] . Using this criteria, the independence model was a comparatively worse fit to the data (RMSEA = .049, Chi-Squared = 15000.14 (df = 39, p<.001), CFI = .92). Parsimony would suggest selecting the full mediation model, and examining the regression weights estimated in the partial mediation model ( Figure 5 ) to compare the direct path to libertarian self-identification versus the mediated paths for Disgust Sensitivity (.02 vs. .29/−.10), Psychological Reactance (−.21 vs. .46/.66), and Empathic Concern (−.02 vs. .61/−.29), suggests that direct effects are relatively small.   10.1371/journal.pone.0042366.g005  Figure 5   Structural Equation Model showing relationship between libertarian dispositions and values.     We also tested these mediation models using a procedure developed by Baron & Kenny [70] , adapted for a dichotomous outcome [71] , and the results converged with the results of these SEM analyses in that a significant (Sobel Test, p<.01 in each case) percentage of the relationship between dispositions and libertarian self-identification was mediated by values in each path. However, more variance in libertarian self-identification was mediated via the Empathic Concern->Individualizing Values path (56%) and Psychological Reactance-Liberty Values path (76%) compared to the Disgust Sensitivity-Binding Values path (11%). Overall, consistent with the results that Lewis & Bates [9] found using liberals and conservatives, the effect of dispositional variables on libertarian self-identification is largely mediated by related values.    Study 2 Summary: How Do Libertarians Think and Feel?  As predicted, libertarians showed lower levels of emotional responsiveness on standard measures of the moral emotions of disgust and empathy ( Figure 3 ). Multivariate analyses indicate that, consistent with McAdams' personality model and previous research on these moral emotions, these dispositions relate to values, in ways which may predispose some individuals to choose to identify as libertarian. From an intuitionist perspective, libertarians' relative lack of emotional reactions may help explain the generally low levels of moral concern that we found in Study 1 (see also [25] ). McCrae and Costa [51] argue that low levels of neuroticism, agreeableness, and extraversion are indicative of an unemotional style. Libertarians were the only group to report a more systematic, rather than empathic, way of understanding the world, a characteristic of men [62] that may explain why libertarianism appeals to men more than women. If morality is driven largely by emotional reactions, and if libertarians are less emotional on most of the measures we examined, then libertarians should be moved by fewer moral concerns, as was the case in Study 1.  Libertarians did display high scores, however, on one measure of emotional reactivity, the Hong Reactance scale ( Figure 3 ), which was found to lead to libertarian values and ideological identification. This pattern is quite consistent with the pattern of moral evaluations expressed in Study 1 where libertarians' low valuation of traditional moral concerns contrasted sharply with the uniquely high moral value they placed on liberty. Libertarians also reported lower levels of agreeableness, measured using items such as “likes to cooperate with others,” and related to psychological reactance [72] . Psychological reactance may provide an intuitionist explanation [8] for the libertarian moralization of liberty.  The use of liberty rhetoric may have different psychological origins in different political groups. Autonomy is posited to be a universal basic human psychological need [73] , and thus liberals may be attracted to liberty as a means of improving the psychological welfare of individuals. Similarly, social conservatives may be attracted to liberty as a means toward opposing redistributive taxation policies that challenge the status quo, yet still feel comfortable with the lifestyle liberty constraints that tradition and conformity require (see [22] for an explanation of this inconsistency). In contrast, libertarians may not see liberty as a means, but rather as an end, in and of itself, based on their heightened feelings of psychological reactance. The idea that libertarians are dispositionally more reactant than others when confronted with societal constraints is a potential gut-level explanation for their moralization of liberty. It is also evident in libertarians' fondness for the historical phrase “Don't Tread on Me,” which became a slogan of Ron Paul's 2008 presidential campaign and is frequently displayed on signs and flags at rallies for Tea Party supporters.  Consistent with their stated preference for rationality, libertarians seem to enjoy effortful and thoughtful cognitive tasks ( Figure 4 ). In combination with low levels of emotional reactivity, the highly rational nature of libertarians may lead them to a logical, rather than emotional, system of morality, explaining their unique pattern of scores on the moral psychology measures used in Study 1. This logical system of morality may have led libertarians to be able to provide correct, rather than intuitive, answers on the cognitive reflection task, and to make more utilitarian judgments in the moral dilemmas presented to them in Study 2. Libertarians report being relatively open to new experiences and desiring stimulation, yet given the pattern of results from this study, it is likely true that libertarians may prefer intellectually stimulating experiences over emotionally stimulating experiences (e.g. social experiences). We examine this idea further in Study 3.  In conclusion, we found strong support for our second prediction, that libertarians will rely upon emotion less – and reason more – than will either liberals or conservatives. Further, multi-variate models suggest that these emotional differences may lead to certain value orientations which in turn predispose individuals toward libertarian self-identification. In the next section we explore how these value orientations may also have roots in specific patterns of (and attitudes about) social relationships, consistent with theories about the social function of moral reasoning [17] , [29] , [30] , [33] .    Study 3: How Do Libertarians Relate to Others?   “ To say ‘I love you’ one must first be able to say the ‘I.’”   - Ayn Rand (1943)    One of the primary purposes of moral concerns such as conformity, tradition, authority, and group-loyalty is to bind individuals together [31] . The same areas of the brain that are essential to normal, implicit, intuitive moral reasoning have also been found to be essential for navigating the human social world [74] . The libertarian endorsement of the liberty principle might be related to their lower levels of agreeableness and higher levels of psychological reactance, but it could also result, in part, from lower levels of extraversion, and a desire to be free of the constraints that relationships often entail. Libertarians may be members of an ultra-social species who prefer less social connection than their liberal and conservative peers.  Study 3 tests the idea that libertarians will be more individualistic and less collectivist compared to both liberals and conservatives , suggesting that their moral concern for liberty may represent the conversion of this preference into a value [10] . Moral concerns exist, at least in part, to serve one's own desire for social connection [33] , and it therefore would logically follow that a group that has less desire for social connection would also have fewer moral concerns. To that end we assessed libertarians' sense of interconnectedness and their love for close others, such as friends, family, and romantic partners, as well as their attachments to abstract entities like one's community, country, and the world. We examined whether libertarian patterns of individualism and collectivism do indeed relate to their moral profile, predisposing them toward the libertarian ideology.    Individualism-Collectivism  The Individualism-Collectivism scale [75] is a 32-item scale that measures an individual's levels of independence vs. interdependence. Individualists tend to emphasize self-reliance, independence and (sometimes) competition. There are two types of individualism: horizontal individualism reflects a belief that people are separate (independent) but equal entities (e.g. “I am a unique individual”), and vertical individualism emphasizes hierarchy and competitiveness between those separate entities (“It is important that I do my job better than others”). Collectivists, on the other hand, tend to emphasize cooperation, and (sometimes) equality. As with individualism, there are two kinds of collectivism, a more egalitarian (horizontal) dimension (e.g. “The well-being of my coworkers is important to me.”) and a more hierarchical (vertical) one (e.g. “Children should be taught to place duty before pleasure.”). The measure was completed by 2,975 participants (1,468 men; 1,987 liberals, 390 conservatives, and 291 libertarians).   Results  Table 4 shows that libertarians scored lowest on both forms of collectivism, and highest on horizontal individualism, while matching conservatives on their high scores (relative to liberals) on vertical individualism.    Interpretation  Libertarians appear more individualistic and less collectivistic than both liberals and conservatives. The relative preference for individualism occurs in both hierarchical and non-hierarchical circumstances.     Identification with All of Humanity  The Identification with All of Humanity Scale [76] is a 27-item measure of connection to people in one's community, one's country, and the world. It asks 9 questions concerning each of these three groups (e.g. “How much would you say you have in common with the following groups?”). The measure was completed by 12,503 participants (7,334 men; 8,219 liberals, 1,667 conservatives, and 1,450 libertarians).   Results  Table 4 shows that libertarians are less identified with their community compared to both liberals and conservatives. They also scored low (just below liberals) on identification with country, which was the dimension that conservatives most strongly endorsed. In addition, they scored low (equal to conservatives) on identification with people all over “the world,” which was the dimension that liberals most strongly endorsed.    Interpretation  Consistent with the libertarian desire for personal liberty, libertarians feel relatively low levels of connection to their community, country, and people globally. This pattern suggests that libertarians are likely to join conservatives in opposing transnational humanitarian undertakings, and they are likely to join with liberals in opposing projects and legislation that are aimed at strengthening national identity.     Different Types of Love scale  The Different Types of Love scale [77] is a 40-item measure of loving feelings toward four different groups. Participants indicate agreement with statements concerning friends (e.g., “The connection I feel to my friends is strengthened by all we have in common”), family (“My Mom and/or Dad's acts of unconditional love fill me with strong feelings of love”), generic others (“Doing kind things for others is a reward in itself”), and their romantic partner (“I feel love whenever anything reminds me of my partner”; participants are asked to skip all questions that do not apply). Cronbach's Alpha for each sub-scale of the Different Types of Love scale were .80 (friends), .85 (family), .87 (generic others), & .82 (romantic partners). The measure was completed by 2,776 participants (1,437 men; 1,894 liberals, 325 conservatives, and 310 libertarians).   Results  Table 4 shows that libertarians showed the lowest levels of loving feelings toward others, across all four categories (although the difference with conservatives on love for friends was not significant).    Interpretation  Consistent with the results on the Identification with All of Humanity scale, the libertarian independence from others is associated with weaker loving feelings toward friends, family, romantic partners, and generic others. It is noteworthy that differences between liberals and conservatives were generally small (except toward generic others). Libertarians were the outliers.     Does libertarian individualism relate to libertarian values?  In order to answer this question, we conducted a principal component analysis to determine if these variables could be grouped into common ‘sociality’ factors and if libertarians do indeed score low on them. Further, we wanted to relate these factors to value clusters from Study 1.   Principal Component Analysis  Principal component analysis using the Individualism-Collectivism Scale, Identification with All Humanity Scale, and Different Types of Love Scale was conducted on 630 participants who completed all three measures. The scree plot [49] indicated a 2 factor solution was appropriate, including a group of broad connection, more universalist oriented variables (e.g. love of friends, identification with the world) which are more typical of liberals, and a group of tight connection, close group oriented variables (e.g. love of family, identification with country) which are more typical of conservatives. Factor loadings for all variables in Study 3 are listed in Table 6 . Figure 6 , using standardized factor scores extracted for each participant, shows that libertarians have both lower levels of broad social connection and lower levels of tight social connection.   10.1371/journal.pone.0042366.g006  Figure 6   Libertarians are less connected to others, including both broad and tight social connections.     10.1371/journal.pone.0042366.t006 Table 6  Principle Components Analysis Factor Loadings of Variables in Study 3.

Factor loadings >|.5| bolded.     Of these participants, 590 also completed the Moral Foundations Questionnaire. Variables indicative of “Other Oriented Values” correlated positively with the broad social connection factor (MFQ-harm: r  = .60, p <.001, MFQ-fairness: r  = .42, p <.001, MFQ-authority: r  = −.18, p <.001, MFQ-ingroup: r  = −.14, p <.01, MFQ-purity: r  = −.07, p  = .07), while variables indicative of “Conservative Values” correlated positively with the tight social connection factor (MFQ-harm: r  = .02, p  = .61, MFQ-fairness: r  = .01, p  = .85, MFQ-authority: r  = .51, p <.001, MFQ-ingroup: r  = .50, p <.001, MFQ-purity: r  = .44, p <.001).    Interpretation  Factor analyses indicate that the variables in Study 3 can be grouped into measures of tight social connection and measures of broad social connection. Libertarians score lower on both of these factors ( Figure 6 ). If we relate Moral Foundation Questionnaire variables to these factors, we find that the values that typify liberals (MFQ-harm and MFQ-fairness) relate to this first factor, while the values that typify conservatives (MFQ-authority, ingroup, and purity) relate to this second factor. This is evidence for the idea that “moral thinking is for social doing” [33] , as the moralities of liberals and conservatives empirically relate to the types of relationships and identifications that they seek. Notably, libertarians report lower valuation of both typically liberal and conservative concerns ( Figures 1 and 2 ) and correspondingly lower connectedness to the groups that typically are connected to either liberals or conservatives ( Figure 6 ).     Study 3 Summary: How Do Libertarians Relate to Others?  As predicted, libertarians in our sample appeared to be strongly individualistic. Compared to liberals and conservatives, they report feeling a weaker sense of connection to their family members, romantic partners, friends, communities, and nations, as well as to humanity at large. While liberals exhibit a horizontal collectivistic orientation and conservatives a vertical collectivistic orientation, libertarians exhibit neither type of collectivism, instead displaying a distinctly individualistic orientation. This relative preference for individualism may have been moralized [10] into the value orientation found in Study 1.  Libertarians' weaker social interconnectedness is consistent with the idea that they have weaker moral intuitions concerning obligations to and dependence on others (e.g. Moral Foundation Questionnaire scores). If “moral thinking is for social doing” [33] , then libertarians lack of social connection naturally means that they have less use for moral thinking. Their distaste for submitting to the needs and desires of others helps explain why libertarians have very different ways of relating to groups, consistent with their lower endorsement of values related to altruism, conformity, and tradition in Study 1, providing convergent evidence for the idea that moral judgment is tightly related to social functioning.     Conclusions  While not all libertarians endorse the views of Ayn Rand, our findings can be summarized by the three quotations we have presented from her work. We began Study 1 with Rand's exhortation to reject “the morality of altruism,” and we showed that libertarians do indeed reject this morality, as well as all other moralities based on ideas of obligation to other people, groups, traditions, and authorities. Libertarians scored relatively high on just one moral concern: liberty. The libertarian pattern of response was found to be empirically distinct from the responses of liberals and conservatives, both in our cluster analysis of participants and in our principal components analysis of measures. We found strong support for our first prediction: Libertarians will value liberty more strongly and consistently than liberals or conservatives, at the expense of other moral concerns.  We introduced Study 2 with Rand's claim that Western culture can only be reborn when it can be founded on “a rational ethics.” Consistent with Rand's writing and psychological research concerning the intuitive origins of moral reasoning [8] , we found that libertarians were indeed less emotional (less disgust sensitivity, empathic concern, and neuroticism) than liberals and conservatives. This lack of emotional reactivity may underlie an indifference towards common moral norms, and an attraction to an ideology where these moral codes are absent, libertarianism. The only emotional reaction on which libertarians were not lowest was reactance – the angry reaction to infringements upon one's autonomy – for which libertarians scored higher than both liberals and conservatives. This disposition toward reactance may lead to the moralization of liberty and an attraction to an ideology that exalts liberty above other moral principles – namely, libertarianism.  We also found that libertarians showed a strong preference for and enjoyment of reasoning (higher on utilitarianism, need for cognition, systemizing, and a greater likelihood of answering correctly on the cognitive reflection task). We think it is worth repeating that libertarians were the only one of our three groups for which systemizing scores were higher, in absolute terms, than their empathizing scores, suggesting that libertarians are the only group that may be psychologically prepared for the Randian revolution of “rational ethics.” Thus, we found strong support for our second prediction: Libertarians will rely upon emotion less – and reason more – than will either liberals or conservatives .  We introduced Study 3 with Rand's condemnation of love that is not based on a strong sense of self. We found that libertarians do indeed have a strong sense of self and the self's prerogatives, and a correspondingly lower sense of attachment to others. They exhibit a high degree individualism, a low degree collectivism, and generally report feeling less bonding with others, less loving for others, and less feelings of a sense of common identity with others. Libertarians have a lower degree of the broad social connection that typifies liberals as well as a lower degree of the tight social connections that typify conservatives. These social preferences were related to their moral attitudes suggesting that libertarians have less functional use for moral concerns. We found strong support for out third prediction: Libertarians will be more individualistic and less collectivist compared to both liberals and conservatives.   Personality and Ideology  The current research extends past comparisons between liberals and conservatives to a third ideological group — libertarians. Our findings are consistent with the emerging view that personality plays a crucial role in the formation of ideology. As is the case with liberals and conservatives [3] , libertarian ideological identification is characterized by specific moral concerns, a level 2 characteristic adaptation in McAdams' [23] model of personality. But why do people develop differential preferences for specific moral concerns? Both McAdams' more general theory and recent theory specifically concerning the development of moral reasoning [8] posit that these constructs are often related to and constrained by level 1 traits; for example, previous research has shown that people who are dispositionally high on openness to experience are more likely to develop liberal values [1] , whereas people who are dispositionally high on disgust sensitivity are more likely to develop conservative values [14] . Further, consistent with widely tested theories of motivated reasoning [26] , people are likely to moralize their preferences [10] , especially their social preferences, given the interplay between social functioning and moral reasoning [30] , [33] .  The current research not only describes an important ideological group, but also tells a coherent story about how and why some people become libertarians while others become liberals or conservatives. While we cannot establish causality with our correlational data, we can see several cross-level links of the sort described by McAdams and Pals [35] and modeled by Lewis and Bates [9] . People who are dispositionally more (at level 1) open to new experiences and reactant are more likely to find themselves drawn to some classically liberal philosophers (such as John Stuart Mill) and classically liberal values and ideals (such as the superordinate value of individual liberty, at level 2). But if these same people are also highly individualistic and low on empathic concern — if they simply feel the suffering of other people less — then they might feel little emotional attraction to modern liberalism's emphasis on altruism and positive liberty, and turned off by its willingness to compel some citizens to help other citizens (through redistributive tax policies). When they first encounter libertarian philosophy (or read an Ayn Rand novel or hear a Ron Paul speech), they find an ideological narrative (level 3) that resonates with their values and their emerging political likes and dislikes (level 2). They begin identifying themselves as libertarians, which reinforces their moral beliefs. They find it easier to reject statements endorsing altruism (or group loyalty or respect for authority) than they would have before having discovered libertarianism and its rationalist, individualist ethos.  A related way to describe the links between personality and morality is found in Rozin's [10] description of the moralization of preferences. Libertarians' preferences about how to live their lives may have been transformed into a moral value — the value of liberty — in the same way that vegetarians have been found to moralize their eating preferences [78] or non-smokers moralize their aversion to smoke [79] . From a social intuitionist perspective [8] , this process is no different from the psychological comfort that liberals attain in moralizing their empathic responses (e.g. [15] ) or that social conservatives attain in moralizing their connection to their groups (e.g. [43] ). For those who self-identify as libertarian in our sample, their dispositional and motivational profiles all point toward one supreme moral principle: individual liberty.  The current research examined a specific ideological group in the United States, but just as research on other distinctive groups such as patients with brain lesions [30] or psychopaths [80] has been generative for understanding morality more broadly, so too do we hope that the current research is generative for researchers seeking to understand political processes in diverse socio-demographic contexts. The current research, convergent with basic research on the intuitive origins of moral judgment [8] , suggests that similar patterns may be found in other groups that favor less government involvement in both social and economic matters, such as the Free Democratic Party of Germany, which advocates reduced economic regulation, greater privacy, and increased rights for homosexuals. Even in countries without a political identity that mirrors American libertarianism, there are likely to be individuals who reject policies driven by empathy for the poor or promotion of tradition, and those individuals may exhibit some of the same dispositional traits that are characteristic of libertarians in the US context, such as a desire for solitude and a preference for rational over emotional experience. However, without the reinforcing characteristics of a narrative that can bring coherence to these dispositions [36] , these individuals may not have had adequate opportunity to moralize their preferences [10] , and may therefore be more likely to be politically apathetic [81] .    Limitations  This set of studies has two main limitations: our findings rely almost exclusively on self-report measures, and our sample is not representative of the general population. Our reliance on self-report measures is partially mitigated by the fact that we used diverse measures that converge on an extremely consistent picture of libertarianism. The fact that libertarian performance on the Cognitive Reflection Task and their responses to classic moral dilemmas converges with libertarian self-report of their cognitive and emotional style also mitigates some of this concern. Because so little has been written about libertarian psychology, we believe that our very large set of self-report measures is an important first step in characterizing libertarian psychology upon which more methodologically advanced work can build [16] . We hope that this research will inform future researchers who will undoubtedly investigate the relationships we have found using more experimental, behavioral, implicit, and even neuropsychological methods.  Our use of a volunteer internet sample means that we must be cautious in generalizing our findings to the broader population. However, our results generally replicate across gender (see Tables 2 , 3 , and 4 ), as well as sub-samples based on the four most common methods of finding our website (via search engines, the New York Times, Edge.org, or by typing in the URL directly – See Table 7 ), indicating that our findings are robust. Since sub-sample analysis uses implicit browser referrer information that is technically difficult to fake, we can be confident that our results are not the result of any systematic deception by participants. In addition, many of our ancillary findings replicate previous research (e.g. liberals are higher on Openness to Experience [1] , and empathy [15] , conservatives report higher disgust sensitivity [14] ; and greater preference for tradition [4] ), which means that our sample likely bears reasonable resemblance to samples used in previous psychological research. Finally, findings based on the yourmorals.org dataset have been successfully replicated in nationally representative U.S. samples (see, for example, Smith & Vaisey, [82] , replicating findings about liberal-conservative differences on the Moral Foundations Questionnaire).  10.1371/journal.pone.0042366.t007 Table 7  Cohen's d-scores by referrer sub-sample.

The sample tends to be more politically aware, educated, white, and liberal than a representative U.S. sample would be. This reduces the likelihood of confounds due to race or education, but also means that it remains an open question whether the relationships found would hold within a less educated or more racially diverse group. In addition, political and moral differences are likely more salient in the context of our website, meaning that effect sizes may be increased in this setting. The mean values for libertarians in our sample are likely quite different than the mean values for these measures if we were able to examine the population as a whole. However, whereas the mean values derived from our dataset may differ from national averages, the relationships between variables in our dataset have been found to be comparable to nationally representative samples [84] .  Our use of a volunteer internet sample gave us at least three benefits in terms of data quality. First, because volunteers are often more educated and motivated, such samples often show less random measurement error, less survey satisficing, and less social desirability bias compared to nationally representative samples [85] – [87] . Second, unlike many surveys conducted by telephone, we were able to use full and well-validated scales to measure each construct, rather than relying on just one or two items. And third, because nationally representative samples are expensive to procure, they rarely involve more than 2,000 respondents. If self-described libertarians comprise less than 10% of the U.S. population, then nationally representative samples rarely include enough libertarians to make the sort of comparisons we were able to make using our much larger dataset.  While our sample represents a large number of libertarians, it may or may not represent the majority. Not withstanding our cluster analysis in Study 1, libertarianism may also be studied as a dimension that an individual may endorse to varying degrees rather than as a discrete kind of person, which may be one of the reasons that national surveys typically do not measure identification as libertarian. Self-identification as ‘libertarian’ can change meaning over time, further complicating the issue. William James [88] felt that he could best study the human experience of religion by studying its extreme forms. Our sample may be taken from one end of the libertarian dimension, specifically those who are willing to take the psychological step of self-identifying specifically as libertarian. Libertarianism may be a dimension that may exist in both liberals and conservatives to varying degrees, as both liberals and conservatives endorse liberty as a moral value in different domains. In learning about this group of individuals, perhaps we can learn something about the forces that push all individuals towards or away from endorsing liberty as a moral end.    Summary  Political and social psychologists often study ideology on a unidimensional liberal-conservative spectrum, but the real world is clearly more complex. As psychologists advance in studying the personality traits associated with liberalism and conservatism, our findings confirm the value of this approach and extend its reach by describing a heretofore-neglected yet politically important group – libertarians. Libertarians have a unique moral-psychological profile, endorsing the principle of liberty as an end and devaluing many of the moral concerns typically endorsed by liberals or conservatives. Although causal conclusions remain beyond our current reach, our findings indicate a robust relationship between libertarian morality, a dispositional lack of emotionality, and a preference for weaker, less-binding social relationships. These findings are consistent with previous research on the dispositional origins of moral judgment. By focusing on one understudied ideological group, the findings provide further evidence concerning the closely intertwined nature of personality, values, and political ideology.

Sensory attenuation refers to the observation that self-generated stimuli are attenuated, both in terms of their phenomenology and their cortical response compared to the same stimuli when generated externally. Accordingly, it has been assumed that sensory attenuation might help individuals to determine whether a sensory event was caused by themselves or not. In the present study, we investigated whether this dependency is reciprocal, namely whether sensory attenuation is modulated by prior beliefs of authorship. Participants had to judge the loudness of auditory effects that they believed were either self-generated or triggered by another person. However, in reality, the sounds were always triggered by the participants' actions. Participants perceived the tones' loudness attenuated when they believed that the sounds were self-generated compared to when they believed that they were generated by another person. Sensory attenuation is considered to contribute to the emergence of people's belief of authorship. Our results suggest that sensory attenuation is also a consequence of prior belief about the causal link between an action and a sensory change in the environment.  The research leading to these results received funding from the European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007-2013)/ERC Grant Agreement n°263067. The funders had no role in study design, data collection and analysis, decision to publish, or preparation of the manuscript.   info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0037959.g002   Introduction  Many movements result in sensory consequences similar to sensory input elicited by external events. However, several studies observed that self- and externally generated sensory signals are processed differently. Notably, self-generated stimuli are attenuated both in terms of their phenomenology [1] – [3] and their cortical response [4] , [5] compared to the same stimuli externally generated. It has often been assumed that sensory attenuation emerges from internal forward models that predict the sensory consequences of an ongoing action [3] , [6] – [8] . In line with this idea, several studies show that sensory attenuation varies as a function the predictability of the perceptual action consequences [3] , [6] , [9] and that it is genuinely a result of motor prediction and not of prediction in general [1] .  The phenomenon of sensory attenuation has been considered to enhance the ability to differentiate externally triggered sensory changes from self-produced action effects [10] . Moreover, attenuation is also thought to be an important perceptual cue contributing to the emergence of our belief of authorship, i.e., the belief of being the cause of a sensory change in the environment [2] , [11] . The link between sensory attenuation and beliefs of authorship has been emphasized in the study of schizophrenia patients showing symptoms such as delusions of control and thought insertion. Specifically, several studies show that these patients fail to attenuate responses to the sensory consequences of their actions and speech [12] – [15] , thus leading to difficulties in distinguishing internally from externally generated stimuli [15] , [16] .  However, the relationship between sensory attenuation and belief of authorship must not necessarily be a one-way road from sensory attenuation to belief of authorship. It is also possible that authorship beliefs modulate sensory attenuation. Note that the contrasts that have usually been used to assess sensory attenuation compared conditions in which sensory events were either externally triggered or produced by a voluntary action. These conditions differ in motor predictive processes and the causal link between action and effect (prior belief of authorship) at the same time [17] . The present study, using self-produced stimuli in all conditions, investigates whether belief of authorship alone results in sensory attenuation, i.e., whether authorship belief is a driving force behind sensory attenuation instead of merely being inferred from perceived attenuation.  An influence of the belief of authorship on perception has recently been observed in experiments on intentional binding [18] – [20] , i.e., the finding that when a voluntary action produces a sensory event, action and outcome are perceived as closer together in time [21] . This phenomenon has been interpreted to be based on the same predictive motor mechanisms discussed above [22] , [23] . However, two recent studies [24] , [25] suggest that sensory attenuation and intentional binding are not based on the same mechanisms. Thus, it is still unknown whether prior authorship beliefs influence sensory attenuation in the same way.  To shed further light on this issue we assessed the perceived loudness of auditory stimuli [2] , [9] , [26] , [27] in a social setting that allowed for the manipulation of participants' prior belief of authorship. Specifically, participants were led to believe that a sound was either triggered by themselves or by someone else, although, in reality, the sound was always triggered by participants themselves. To foreshadow the results, we found the perceived loudness of the sound to be attenuated when participants believed that the sound was triggered by their own action, compared to when they believed that it was triggered by another agent. We will discuss the implications of the finding in the discussion.    Materials and Methods   Participants  Twelve subjects (average age 22.7 years, SD  = 3.5 years) participated in the experiment for an allowance of € 10/h. All had normal or corrected-to-normal vision and hearing and were naïve as to the hypothesis under investigation. They all gave written informed consent. The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the local Ethics Committee.    Material  Stimulus presentation and data acquisition were conducted using the psychophysics Toolbox [28] , [29] for Matlab 7.5.0 running on a PC computer connected to two 19-in. 85 Hz CRT monitors. Auditory stimuli were presented via a pair of headphones.    Stimuli and procedure  Participants were informed that the experimenter takes part in the experiment as a second participant, as the real second participant has canceled. The experiment consisted of two phases: A belief implementation phase and a test phase. In both phases we used two monitors (one in front of the participant, and the other in front of the experimenter) and one keyboard connected to the same PC.   Belief implementation phase  Participants carried out two conditions in separate blocks of 100 trials each. Block order was counterbalanced across participants. In the self condition the participant's name was displayed on the center of both screens. Participants were required to execute right index finger key presses at a self-paced rate. In the other condition the experimenter's name was displayed on the screens. The participant observed the experimenter executing self-paced key-presses. Both the participants' and the experimenter's key press actions were followed by a 1000 Hz tone after an interval (stimulus onset asynchrony; SOA) of 150, 300 or 450 ms. The tone was presented for 100 ms with a pressure level of 74 dB. The probability that the tone occurred after one of the three intervals was set to .7 for the 300 ms SOA .15 for the 150 ms SOA and .15 for the 450 ms. At the beginning of each block the participant was shown that only the key press of the person whose name was displayed on the screens could trigger the tone. The aim of this phase was to make the participant adopt two contextual beliefs: 1) if my name is displayed, the tone follows my action; 2) if the experimenter's name is displayed, the tone follows his action.  Thereafter, participants ran another belief implementation block that was more similar to the test phase. Here, a clock-face and a clock-hand (rotating with a period of 3 sec.) were displayed on the two screens. The clock-face included a shaded area. The size of the shaded area was 60° of the clock-face; its location was randomly chosen. The participants were shown that only the person whose name was displayed on the screens could trigger the tone by executing a key press while the clock-hand passed through the shaded area (no tone was delivered if that person executed a key press outside the shaded area). The participant's or experimenter's name was displayed either below or above the clock-face (counterbalanced across participants). Participant ran 10 trials per condition (self and other). The second belief implementation phase was meant to familiarize participants with the task procedure of the test phase.    Test phase  The participant and experimenter were separated by a card board. Both saw the same clock-face, clock-hand and a randomly located shaded area on the screen (see above). Participants ran two conditions: a self and an other condition. In these conditions either the participant's ( self condition) or the experimenter's name ( other condition) was displayed on the screens, in order to make the participants believe that, in the given trial, the tone would either be triggered by their own or the experimenter's action. In both conditions, the participant and the experimenter had to execute a key press when the clock-hand passed through the shaded area for the first time. Participants wore sound isolating headphones preventing them to hear and being distracted by the experimenter's key-presses. Furthermore, the experimenter was instructed to avoid any noisy key-presses. Importantly, contrary to the belief implementation phase, the tone was always (expect in some rare case, see below) triggered by the participant's key press regardless of the name displayed on the screens. The tone appeared after one of three SOAs (150, 300 or 450 ms) with the same probability we used in the belief implementation phase. We used three SOAs to introduce variability between the participants' action and the occurrence of the sound. This was meant to prevent the participants from realizing that they triggered the tone in both belief conditions. We chose these three interval probabilities to calibrate internal forward model to predict in particular the tone at 300 ms SOA. Data analysis focused on the 300 ms SOA. The other SOAs were just used to induce the beliefs. Moreover, in order to strengthen the participants' authorship beliefs, the experimenter deactivated the participants' key twice in the other condition and triggered the tone himself (mostly during the second rotation of the hand).  To assess the influence of prior belief on participants loudness perception we used a comparison task procedure that have been previously used to show sensory attenuation of self-generated sensory event [2] , [26] , [27] . At the end of each trial (see Figure 1 ) participants and experimenter were required to compare the loudness of the standard tone (1000 Hz, 100 ms, 74 dB) generated by the key press with a comparison tone of the same frequency and duration but varying in magnitude. The comparison tone was presented after a random interval of 800–1200 ms. Its sound pressure level varied randomly between 71 and 77 dB in 1 dB steps. The participants judged which of the two tones (the standard tone or comparison tone) was louder by pressing with their left hand one of two keys. At the end of the experiment participants had to answer yes or no to the following questions: 1) “Did you believe that whenever your name was displayed on the screens you and not the other participant triggered the first tone?”; 2) “Did you believe that whenever the other participant's name was displayed on the screens s/he and not you triggered the first tone?”.   10.1371/journal.pone.0037959.g001  Figure 1   Schematic representation of an experimental trial.  At the beginning of each trial of both belief conditions the participant's name (self condition) or experimenter's name (other condition) blinked for 800 ms. Then, the name stopped to blink and the clock-hand started to rotate. Participant and experimenter had to execute a key-press when the clock-hand first passed through the shaded area. The participant always triggered the sound in both belief conditions after one of three possible SOAs (150, 300 or 450 ms). After a random interval (between 800–1200 ms) from the occurrence of the first tone a second tone occurred. Finally, 500 ms after the occurrence of the second tone the clock-hand stopped and both participant and experimenter answered the question: “Which one of the two tones was louder?”     The test phase consisted of 200 trials per belief condition (140 trials with 300 ms SOA, and 30 trials for each of the two other SOAs). For the 300 ms SOAs of both belief conditions each of the seven comparison tone magnitudes was presented 20 times. Each belief condition was presented in 10 mini-blocks of 20 trials. Mini-blocks were presented alternately with block presentation being counterbalanced across subjects.      Results  As mentioned above data of the 150 and 450 ms SOA were excluded from analysis. The proportion of “second tone louder” responses for the 300 ms SOA was calculated separately for each participant, condition and the seven magnitudes of the comparison tone. Psychometric functions were fitted using the Psignifit Toolbox version 2.5.6 for Matlab (see http://bootstrap-software.org/psignifit/ ) which implements the maximum-likelihood method described by Wichmann and Hill [30] . Based on each individual function, we calculated the point of subjective equality (PSE) and the just noticeable difference (JND). The PSE, defined as the comparison tone magnitude judged as louder than the first tone on 50% of trials, reflects the perceived loudness intensity of the first tone under the two belief conditions [2] , [26] . For instance, if sensory attenuation is stronger in the self condition, one would expect a significantly lower PSE value in this condition compared to the other condition. The JND, defined as the difference of the comparison tone magnitude judged as louder on 75% and judged as louder on 25% of trials divided by 2, assesses the precision of responses as it reflects the variability of loudness perception. For example, if the self belief manipulation would lead to a general impairment in the amount of available perceptual information (e.g., due to a reduction of attention in this condition) and therefore to an increase of response variability, one would expect a higher JND value in the self condition compared to the other condition. The level of significance of our analysis was set at p<.05 for all statistical tests.  All the participants believed i) that they triggered the sound when their name was displayed on the screen and ii) that the experimenter triggered the sound when his name was displayed. Hence, although in reality the tone was always triggered by the participants' action, they adopted different authorship beliefs in the two conditions.  PSE values of the self and other condition were compared using a paired one-tailed t-test. The analysis revealed that PSE values were significantly lower in the self condition compared to the other condition t(11) = 2.73, p = .010 ( Figure 2 ), indicating a reduction on the perceived intensity of the stimulus in the former compared to the latter.   10.1371/journal.pone.0037959.g002  Figure 2   Proportion of “second tone louder” responses for the 300 ms SOA for the self and other condition (averaged across all participants) as a function of the seven comparison tone magnitudes.     A paired two-tailed t-test on JND values showed no significant difference between the two conditions t(11) = 0.07, p = .943. This indicates that response variability did not differ in the two belief conditions, suggesting that the effect of attenuation we observed in the self condition compared the other condition was specifically related to a reduced intensity perception of the standard tone (PSE) but not to a general reduction in the amount of available perceptual information (JND).    Discussion  Self-generated auditory stimuli have largely been observed to be attenuated compared to those externally generated [2] , [9] , [26] , [27] , [31] – [33] . However, the contrast of self vs. externally produced stimuli differs in both motor predictive processes and authorship belief. Therefore, in the present study we contrasted self-produced stimuli in two conditions differing only in the participants' authorship belief. Both belief conditions were identical in terms of sensorimotor-based temporal predictability, since, unbeknownst to the participant, it was always the participant who triggered the tone. First of all, note that the fact that our manipulation worked (i.e., we successfully induced different belief of authorship), confirms that authorship is not directly perceived but inferred from different cues as prior knowledge and other context-related factors [34] – [36] . More importantly, we found a reduction of the PSE value when participants believed that their own action triggered the tone compared to when they believed that the other participant's action triggered the tone. Our results, thus, show that differences in authorship belief are sufficient to yield sensory attenuation.  One possible explanation for this result is that participants allocate attentional resources differently in the two conditions. Previous studies have shown that allocating more/less attention to stimuli alters their perceived intensity [37] , [38] . However, this explanation seems unlikely to us for two reasons. Firstly, in both conditions participants' attention was likewise oriented to the clock hand. Secondly, Anton-Erxleben et al., [37] (see experiment 3 & 4) showed that in comparison tasks a difference in allocation of attention does not only modulate the perceived intensity of the stimulus (PSE) but also the response variability (reflected by the JND in the present experiment). However, in our experiment the discrimination performance (JND) was identical in the two belief conditions. Thus, it is unlikely that the difference in intensity attenuation (PSE) we observed is due general change in attentional attunement.  The present study demonstrates that differences in authorship belief alone can result in sensory attenuation. However, note that this does not mean to say that internal forward models do not play any role in the emergence of sensory attenuation. In the contrary, we believe that our results can be accounted for in terms of predictive motor processing. Several scenarios are possible. In the most radical one, prior authorship belief determines whether or not the action's consequence is (motor) predicted in the first place. If the sensorimotor system believes that somebody else triggers the upcoming stimulus why should it predict the event? One could argue that, in this case, the system actually makes an invalid prediction, as the prediction might erroneously result in self-attribution of the given stimulation.  A less radical explanation would be that authorship belief influences how reliable the brain considers internal forward models to be. Specifically, depending on whether or not the agent believes to be the cause of an upcoming event, predictive motor signals might get high and low weights, respectively, in a process integrating different cues concerning the self/other distinction of the upcoming stimulus [39] – [41] .  One might argue that the effect we observed was partly due to the fact that participants were not completely free to time their actions, since they had to act within the shaded area. Self-initiated action yield stronger activation of action control structures (e.g., the SMA complex) compared to action that are externally triggered [42] . Although several studies observed sensory attenuation in conditions in which participants responded to a go signal [4] , [6] , [43] (suggesting that internal prediction is still available to the subject), it is possible that weak internal predictive signals (due to the fact that participants were not completely free to time their action) might have made people more susceptible to the influence of external cues such as the prior belief of authorship [39] , [44] . Further research is necessary to clarify this issue.  Our findings might also provide important information for the understanding of delusions of control in schizophrenia. Our results suggest that abnormal prior beliefs of authorship may contribute to the emergence of abnormal perceptions. This is in agreement with recent Bayesian integrative accounts of agency which suggest that people's perception of sensory action consequences and their experience of being in control of their actions is based on the combination of prior knowledge and the likelihood obtained from sensory input [13] , [39] . Our results might indicate that a globally altered belief of oneself as an agent may lead to an inadequate weighting of different authorship indicators, and may, thus, result in the emergence of abnormal perceptions/beliefs in a specific situation. For instance, abnormal beliefs may result in assigning a particular salience to stimuli that in reality have to be attenuated because they are self-generated. These stimuli might feel strange and externally generated [13] , [39] .  Sensory attenuation has usually been assessed comparing self-vs. externally generated stimuli. Three recent studies, for example, observed attenuation of self- vs. externally generated auditory stimuli using exactly the same stimuli and procedure as the present study [2] , [26] , [27] . As mentioned above, this contrast covers, amongst others, motor prediction and authorship belief. The main interest of the present study was to isolate the effect of authorship belief. To do so, we did not necessarily need to include a condition in which stimuli are externally generated. Since the manipulation of authorship belief was rather challenging, we decided to renounce on this type of condition. However, future research could compare the strength of authorship-induced sensory attenuation with the strength of sensory attenuation based on the contrast of external vs. self-produced stimuli to further clarify the different factors contributing to the phenomenon of sensory attenuation.  Finally, we would like to point out one caveat. We (and all other studies using a similar methodology) cannot tell for sure whether our manipulation affected participants' sensitivity or whether it induced a response bias. This is because the PSE may be affected by both response criterion and sensitivity. However, using signal detection theory methodology [45] , Cardoso-Leite et al. [1] recently showed that sensory attenuation (at least in the visual domain) is based on decreased sensitivity and not on a shift in response bias. We therefore feel confident that this also holds for our experiment.  In conclusion, sensory attenuation is usually considered to contribute to the emergence of people's belief of authorship. Our experiment indicates that the relationship between perception and belief is reciprocal, i.e., that sensory attenuation is also shaped by prior authorship belief.
