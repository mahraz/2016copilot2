JSM has submitted a provisional patent for the use of plate readers to quantify reporter activity in living zebrafish. JSM has been awarded a patent on the use of prodrug converting enzyme systems in zebrafish to study regeneration (US patent # 7514595). JRM and MTS are employed at Luminomics Inc., a company that applies the techniques used in this manuscript to define compounds that promote the regeneration of genetically defined cell types.
