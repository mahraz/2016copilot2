Several months after this, the authors provided InnoCentive with a report in which their findings from the data collection were summarized. Aside from helping the authors with data collection, InnoCentive had no role in study design, data analysis, decision to publish, or preparation of the manuscript. Also, InnoCentive did not fund this study and the authors do not (and did not) have any relation with the company (e.g., consultancy, employment, joint patents or products), which might interfere with full and objective presentation of their results.",NA,NA,NA,"2015","07","Oguz Ali Acar","OAA",2,TRUE,1,1,1,2,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,0,NA,FALSE
