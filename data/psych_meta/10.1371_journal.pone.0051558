Goekoop is a psychiatrist working for Parnassia BAVO group, which is strictly a non-profit, non-academic (“peripheral”) mental health care institution. Like many other non-academic centers in The Netherlands, it has turned into a company due to government policies that promote a “market-oriented” view of health care. This does not alter the authors adherence to all the PLOS ONE policies on sharing data and materials. In no way, shape or form, Parnassia Bavo Group has any interest in a commercial exploitation of the findings reported in the present paper.",NA,NA,NA,"2012","12","Rutger Goekoop","RG",3,TRUE,2,1,1,1,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,0,NA,FALSE
