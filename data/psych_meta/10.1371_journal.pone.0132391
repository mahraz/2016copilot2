Performed the experiments: JT. Analyzed the data: JT. Wrote the paper: JT.","The study was commissioned by the commercial company Wavestar A/S. The company wanted an independent report on underwater noise from the Wavestar facility which they were requested to deliver to the responsible regulating agency in order to apply for a permit for further development. The author made the measurements and prepared the report under a commercial contract between Wavestar A/S and University of Aarhus, under the condition that the author and the university would be able to use and publish the results afterwards, irrespective of the nature of the results. Neither has the author as a person, nor the University of Aarhus, any commercial interests in Wavestar A/S or the patents involved in the Wavestar converter. Thus the fact that the work was made under a commercial contract does not in any way alter the authors (and Aarhus Universitys) adherence to PLOS ONE policies on sharing data and materials. The measurements and the original report are available to the public in adherence to the Aarhus Convention on Access to Information, Public Participation in Decision-Making and Access to Justice in Environmental Matters (United Nations Economic Commission for Europe, UNECE).",NA,NA,NA,"2015","07","Jakob Tougaard","JT",1,TRUE,1,1,1,1,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,0,NA,FALSE
