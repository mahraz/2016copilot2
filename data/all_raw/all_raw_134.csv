The competing interests and financial disclosures of both co-authors employed by commercial companies are as follows: Luka Drinovec is employed by the company Aerosol d.o.o. This company produces instruments for the measurement of aerosolized soot (black carbon) and some accessories for aerosol measurement. Aerosol d.o.o. does not have any connection with molecular biology, development of medicines, etc. Thus, the authors declare that there are no competing interests for Luka Drinovec coauthoring the article “Demonstration of a direct interaction between β2-adrenergic receptor and insulin receptor by BRET and bioinformatics”. Response to Reviewers: Jane Nøhr is employed by Novo Nordisk A/S and owns Novo Nordisk A/S company stocks. The work on this paper was done as a part of collaboration with academia, i.e., co-supervision of Maja Mandic at the Veterinary faculty, University of Ljubljana.
