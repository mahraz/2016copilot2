The authors would like to emphasize that, once the study site was chosen, Santam had no role in study design, data collection and analysis, decision to publish, or preparation of the manuscript. Santam’s interest in this study was not for direct financial gain, but rather to use as ‘proof-of-concept’ to inform further in-house business research on how to improve risk assessment techniques in a changing world. Both organizations in the collaboration (Santam and CSIR) committed similar amounts of funding, and the relationship with Santam insurance and the authors can be more correctly described as a ‘knowledge partnership’ than a ‘client-customer relationship’.
