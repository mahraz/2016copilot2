Senior supervision: JSN-V-T.","The authors have read the journal’s policy and have the following competing interests: The University of Nottingham Health Protection and Influenza Research Group is currently in receipt of research funds from GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) and unrestricted educational grants for influenza research from F. Hoffmann-La Roche and Astra Zeneca. The aforementioned funding received from GSK, F. Hoffmann-La Roche and Astra Zeneca did not support any aspect of this study. Professor Van-Tam has received funding to attend influenza related meetings, lecture and consultancy fees and research funding, from several influenza antiviral drug and vaccine manufacturers. All forms of personal remuneration ceased in September 2010, but influenza-related research funding from GSK and F. Hoffmann-La Roche remains current, as stated above. He is a former employee of SmithKline Beecham plc. (now GlaxoSmithKline), Roche Products Ltd, and Aventis-Pasteur MSD (now Sanofi-Pasteur MSD), all prior to 2005, with no outstanding pecuniary interests by way of shareholdings, share options or accrued pension rights. Dr George N. Okoli, Miss Harmony E. Otete and Dr Charles R. Beck have no potential conflicts of interest to declare. This does not alter the authors’ adherence to PLOS ONE policies on sharing data and materials."

AMGEN was not involved in the design of the trial, in the collection, analysis, interpretation or publication of the results of the INOGAD trial. In addition, the INOGAD trial was examining the impact of a nutritional intervention, and did not include any specific recommendations regarding the use of medications produced by AMGEN. In INOGAD study e-CRF the question of injection of erythropoietin or G-CSF (Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor) from any brand is asked at each chemotherapy session.
