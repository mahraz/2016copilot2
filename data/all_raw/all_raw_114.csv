The company wanted an independent report on underwater noise from the Wavestar facility which they were requested to deliver to the responsible regulating agency in order to apply for a permit for further development. The author made the measurements and prepared the report under a commercial contract between Wavestar A/S and University of Aarhus, under the condition that the author and the university would be able to use and publish the results afterwards, irrespective of the nature of the results. Neither has the author as a person, nor the University of Aarhus, any commercial interests in Wavestar A/S or the patents involved in the Wavestar converter. Thus the fact that the work was made under a commercial contract does not in any way alter the author’s (and Aarhus University’s) adherence to PLOS ONE policies on sharing data and materials.
