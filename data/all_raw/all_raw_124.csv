Wrote the paper: LCG DRP PCE AIO EM JG ØJ.","The paper is a part of the authors' research at SINTEF Fisheries and Aquaculture to expand the understanding of biofouling on aquaculture nets and to complement the work conducted in the Bio-fouling and bio-cleaning project, which is part of the Centre of Research-based innovation in Aquaculture Technology located at SINTEF. Substantial parts of the work were funded through a PhD fellowship at the University of Science and Technology in Trondheim, Norway. The PhD was completed in November 2013 and most of the contents of this manuscript are included in the PhD thesis. It is common in Norway for a PhD thesis to consist of an introduction followed by a collection of articles published during the PhD period. This article could unfortunately not be finished completely before the PhD thesis had to be submitted to the University and the unfinished manuscript was included in the thesis as an article in preparation. Author Gansel hopes this does not interfere with regulations regarding double publishing of the contents of this manuscript. All authors were employed at SINTEF Fisheries and Aquaculture at the time the experiments were planned and conducted. Two authors did in the meantime change their job and are now working for commercial companies (den Norske Veritas and Statoil). This does not alter the authors' adherence to PLOS ONE policies on sharing data and materials. There are no competing interests for any of the authors."
