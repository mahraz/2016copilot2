S. patent application on June 18, 2011, which describes the potential use of Sindbis vectors in combination with chemotherapeutic agents and NK cells. In that application we will provide evidence that the disclosed methods of treating tumors, especially with alphaviral vectors, are particularly efficient if the mammal undergoing treatment has at least a partially functional immune system. In a specific embodiment, the invention provides the evidence that the methods of treating tumors using Sindbis virus-based vectors are more efficient in the presence of functional natural killer (NK) cells. The filing of this patent application does not alter the authors' willingness to adhere to all the PLoS ONE policies on sharing data and materials. The authors expect that in the future, after Sindbis vectors are tested for their safety in a human phase I clinical trial, phase I/II trials might include additional agents, such as Sindbis plus a chemotherapeutic drug, or Sindbis plus NK cells. All patents stemming from our work are the property of NYU School of Medicine, which has licensed Sindbis related intellectual property to CynVec in exchange for research funding and future royalties to the university. The authors might benefit by sharing in any future royalty stream or equity received by NYU related to this work, in accordance with the rules promulgated in the bylaws of the university. None of the investigators in the submitted manuscript are or will be involved in clinical trials. None of the investigators involved in the manuscript are paid consultants to CynVec, though they do help when needed to transfer the know-how involved in the intellectual property."
