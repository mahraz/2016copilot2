There is no competing interest with GlaxoSmithKline with this fellowship award. The funding from “Merck” as an AllerGen/Canadian Allergy, Asthma and Immunology Foundation (CAAIF)/Merck International Clinician-Scientist and Post-Doctoral Research Fellowship to EC is administered by AllerGen, a government funded National Centre of Excellence. There is no competing interest with Merck with this salary award. The funding from “GlaxoSmithKline” as a GSK-CIHR Chair in Airway Inflammation and from AIHS to LC are salary awards scholarships. Therefore there is no competing interest with GlaxoSmithKline. AIHS is not a commercial source but is a publicly funded, board-governed corporation that operates under an Act of the Alberta provincial legislature. Cover Letter The “AstraZeneca Canada Inc.” in ADB's title is to acknowledge his chair position as a courtesy, but ADB has no commercial relationship with them. In 1991, Astra Canada endowed a Chair in Asthma Research to the University of Alberta; Astra merged with Zeneca much later and the name of the endowment/chair was altered. This endowment is under the full control of the University and there is no formal affiliation with AstraZeneca. Therefore there is no competing interest with AstraZeneca Canada Inc.
