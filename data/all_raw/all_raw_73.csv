This research was not in direct support of a product or commercial development of CFD Research Corporation but was an effort supporting a US Government research need. This research was not funded with any CFD Research Corporation corporate funds or any commercial funding from any source. Dr. Phillip E. Whitley was 51% employee whose time was supported during this research effort as an hourly employee that receives no benefits and has no stocks or ownership or holdings in the company in any way. The work performed by the University of Iowa under this effort provided valuable information to assist in computational model validation which will be freely available to all by open source publication. Given the intended use of this information, Dr. Whitley’s was an active collaborator in design and analysis of data. Further the collaboration in study design insured that the experimental conditions and collected data were usable for subsequent model validation.
