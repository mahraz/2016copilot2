However, the results of the present study did not result in the discovery of new flavors and are not connected to this IP in any way, which made it possible to publish them.

They felt that for genetic analysis of patients with hearing impairment in which many gene/gene mutations are involved, Invader Assay is the appropriate choice. However, for patent reasons, the authors cannot develop this method independently. The development of this method was therefore performed in collaboration with Biomedical Laboratories. This relationship had no influence on results and the direct sequencing results were all double checked for accuracy. Although Invader Assay is more efficient, if a method other than Invader Assay had been used, the results would have been identical."
