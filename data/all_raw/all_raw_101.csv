Abstract: Compositions that inhibit the binding of Plasmodium falciparum to erythrocytes are provided. More particularly, antibodies specific for Plasmodium falciparum binding proteins and blocking peptides that prevent the binding of Plasmodium falciparum are included in the present invention. The methods provided utilize the antibody and peptide compositions provided herein and include methods for the diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of Plasmodium falciparum diseases such as malaria as well as methods for the detection of Plasmodium falciparum in biological samples and culture media.

Abstract: Synthetic gene sequences encoding erythrocyte binding protein of a malaria pathogen for the expression of the erythrocyte binding protein. The codon composition of the synthetic gene sequences approximates the mammalian codon composition. The synthetic gene sequences are useful for incorporation into the DNA vaccine vectors, for the incorporation into various expression vectors for production of malaria proteins, or both. The synthetic genes may be modified to avoid post-translational modification of the encoded protein in hosts. Administration of the synthetic gene sequences, or the encoded protein, as an immunization agent is useful for induction of immunity against malaria, treatment of malaria, or both.
