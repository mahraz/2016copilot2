IBH has led projects for health professionals and the community supported by governmental, community agency, and drug industry partners (Wyeth, Eli Lily, Servier, Pfizer, Astra Zeneca) for the identification and management of depression and anxiety. He has served on advisory boards convened by the drug industry in relation to specific antidepressants, including nefazodone, duloxetine, and desvenlafaxine, and has participated in a multicenter clinical trial of agomelatine effects on sleep architecture in depression. He has participated in Servier-sponsored educational programs related to circadian-based therapies. DFH has previously received honoraria for educational seminars from Janssen-Cilag. MARH has received financial support from Eli- Lily for a multisite trial of cognitive remediation in psychosis, and is a co-investigator in an Australian Rotary funded project investigating the synergistic effects of cognitive remediation and vocational training in psychosis. She was also a co-investigator in a drug trial with Novartis pharmaceutical who sponsored overseas travel in 2011, and was also involved in NHMRC funded trials in psychosis. EMS has received honoraria for educational seminars related to the clinical management of depressive disorders supported by Servier and Eli-Lilly pharmaceuticals.
