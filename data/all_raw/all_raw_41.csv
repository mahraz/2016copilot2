This study was partly funded by the Shell Center for Sustainability, Rice University. We received in-kind donations of equipment and testing materials from the following organizations: Getinge USA (biological testing materials), WAFCO (non-electric steam sterilizers), KeySurgical (brushes), Certol (enzymatic and other cleaners), NovoSurgical (medical instruments), Protek Specialty Company, Bellaire, Texas (water pump). Jean Boubour is the founder of the Association Soleil-Vapeur which is a non-profit organization in France that was formed to produce the capteur soleil, a solar-thermal device. The device was created but never commercialized. Only prototypes exist. The authors used one of these prototypes for operating an autoclave (see manuscript, Reference 7) which they deployed as a pilot study in Sierra Leone in 2013. At present, work has been discontinued on that project.
