Algeta has approved patents and pending patent applications: Regarding thorium-227 conjugates, deriving from the PCT application WO01/39806 A1, and regarding using thorium-227 therapy, deriving from the PCT application WO04/091668 A1. There are presently no products in Development relating to these patents or patent applications. The current study is not part of any thorium-227 development program; however Algeta supported this study by providing the 227Th-DOTA-p-benzyl-trastuzumab and some material cost according to a collaboration agreement between Algeta and the Norwegian Radium Hospital. EMBs contribution to the study was performance of the radiolabeling including analysis of specific activity and IRF, and contribution to manuscript writing of these specific parts of the manuscript describing the radiolabeling and IRF procedure. Jostein Dahle owns a small amount of shares in Algeta ASA. There are no further interests to declare with regards to employment, consultancy, patents or products in development. Jostein Dahle was until January 2011 heading the Radioimmunotherapy group at Department of Radiation Biology, Institute for Cancer Research.

ADI is committed to strengthening Alzheimer associations worldwide, raising awareness regarding dementia and Alzheimer's disease, and advocating for more and better services for people with dementia and their caregivers. ADI is supported in part by grants from GlaxoSmithKline, Novartis, Lundbeck, Pfizer, and Eisai. Concerning the relationship with ADI, the 10/66 Dementia Research Group is an autonomous research network administered from the Institute of Psychiatry, King's College London. Its relationship with Alzheimer's Disease International is primarily around research dissemination; the 10/66 project website is hosted on the ADI server, and the cost of developing the site was met by ADI. 10/66 routinely makes a report of ongoing projects to the ADI Council, and have provided training at ADI's Alzheimer Universities. 10/66 have not received funding from ADI to conduct research, and ADI has no influence upon or input into 10/66 published research outputs. Martin Prince (but not the 10/66 DRG per se), through IoP/ KCL has received three small grants from ADI to fund researchers based at IoP/ KCL to work on the 2009, 2010, and 2011 World Alzheimer reports (not part of the present study).

CG has been involved in the process of preparing and developing the National Pandemic Plan since 2002. During the pandemic CG was in charge of the coordination of the Executive Committee for outbreaks and health emergencies in Chile. This committee was responsible for making decisions and implementing measures for prevention and control. Also, until August 2010, CG participated in the implementation of IHR 2005 in Chile. During the pandemic, the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) provided funds to the Ministry of Health and the Institute of Public Health for studies and improvement of epidemiological surveillance. CG was not responsible for managing these resources. PAHO also delivered primers and other supplies for the laboratory diagnosis of influenza (RT-PCR). They provided computers for influenza sentinel centers for improving the opportunity of reporting, which also included the development of a web application for online notification. CG was a member of the Review Committee on the Functioning of the International Health Regulations (2005) and on Pandemic Influenza A (H1N1), 2009, between April 2010 and April 2011. The result of the work of this committee was submitted to the World Health Assembly in May 2011. In December 2010 (29 November to 15 December) CG was part of a mission to assess the health sector response to pandemic influenza A (H1N1) in Mexico. This mission was requested by the Ministry of Health of Mexico to PAHO. Other mission members were Dr. Jarbas Barbosa (Brazil), Dr. Hande Harmanci (WHO), Dr. Juan Pablo Sarmiento (Colombia), Dr. Ronald St. John (Canada). For this work CG received airfare and per diem supplemented by the standards of PAHO. CG has been invited to present the Chilean experience during the influenza pandemic 2009 in various national and international conferences. CG currently works at the Universidad del Desarrollo (Santiago, Chile) as a teacher and researcher; also at EPI-Sur Consultants, an institution dedicated to providing advisory services and consulting in the field of international health for agencies, governments, and NGOs. EPI-Sur Consultants have worked for PAHO in the field of infectious diseases (not on influenza). VJL has received unrelated research funding from GlaxoSmithKline. JT received a travel grant from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (via an Influenza Cooperative Agreement Grant) to attend the “Options for the Control of Influenza VII” conference in Hong Kong, 3–7 September 2010, to present a poster entitled “Fatal pandemic influenza A(H1N1)2009 infections in HIV-infected persons, South Africa.” All other authors have declared that no competing interests exist."
