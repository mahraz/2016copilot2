The author's employer (Audubon California) received a contract to analyze California least tern data from the Navy at one study site in California. The author managed that project. Outside of that contract, the author undertook the analysis of freely available statewide data to understand demographic trends at a larger spatial and temporal scale. The broader analysis, performed on the author's own time, resulted in this manuscript. This does not alter the author's adherence to all the PLoS ONE policies on sharing data and materials. 2. Audubon California submitted a letter to USFWS suggesting that California least tern not be down-listed from endangered to threatened in part because the understanding of demographic trends and their causes was incomplete. This manuscript represents the author's own effort to advance understanding and appropriate assessment of its recovery status by precisely quantifying trends and developing testable hypotheses for causes of variation in fecundity and productivity. This does not alter the author's adherence to all the PLoS ONE policies on sharing data and materials. 3. The data used in the author's analyses are freely available. He would be happy to offer his data set and the R code used to analyze them to anyone interested."
