Pfizer in Taiwan came to visit our team in year 2011 for supporting a study of ALK rearrangement in NSCLC patients in Taiwan, which was important for them, since this data was still lacking in Taiwan (the data of China and Hong Kong has been published in year 2010 and 2009, respectively). They wished to support a study that could include more than 300 NSCLC patients (naive to ALK inhibitor treatment) and including FISH detection method. They mainly wanted to know the incidence of ALK rearrangements in the NSCLC patients in Taiwan. Pfizer announced that they would not interfere with the study design, methods, results and future publications. By the end of the grant support, we only need to submit a brief report of the study results, which was similar to other funding sources. Thus, we decided to accept this grant from Pfizer after this agreement. In late 2012, we have submitted a two-page brief summary report to Pfizer on time (the end of the grant support), which only included the raw data. After that, we don't need to give any further information to Pfizer. Dr. Shiu-Feng Huang has been invited as the member of Pfizer's Advisory committee in NSCLC study in Taiwan. There are no patents, products in development or marketed products to declare. This does not alter our adherence to all the PLOS ONE policies on sharing data and materials, as detailed online in the guide for authors."

SZ was a postdoctoral fellow in the laboratory of MK at MIT at the time of the invention and patent application.

Patent information on HypoE mice for PLOS ONE: Title: Inducible heart attack animal model Patent number: 7514592 Inventors: Monty Krieger, Songwen Zhang, Sharon L. Karackattu Original Assignee: Massachusetts Institute of Technology Filing and Issue dates: Apr 5, 2005, Apr 7, 2009 An animal model of coronary heart disease has been developed where myocardial infarct can be induced by altering the animal’s diet. In all embodiments, this animal model is a result of reduced activity of scavenger receptor class BI (SR-BI) and apolipoprotein E (ApoE). In a preferred embodiment, the model is a result of crossbreeding two transgenic mouse lines: a knockout of SR-BI (SR-BI−/−) and an impaired ApoE expressor (hypoE). The impaired ApoE gene results in only 2–5% expression of ApoE and a reduction in cholesterol homeostasis. Resulting animals are predisposed to hypercholesterolemia but can live longer than a year on a normal low fat diet. Serum plasma levels can be significantly elevated by changing the animal’s diet to one containing high levels of fat and cholesterol. Within a month on a high fat, high cholesterol diet, animals develop atherosclerosis and myocardial infarction occurs. Survival depends on the nature of the diet and the conditions of animal husbandry."
