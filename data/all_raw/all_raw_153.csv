As a faculty member of the University of California, HW is required to protect patentable inventions for the University. Since the priority date on this patent is 1/06/2000 it was recently abandoned by the University of California due to its approaching expiration. HW is also an inventor on a patent (US 2004-958997; WO 2006041800; Applicant: The Regents of the University of California; Title: 5-phenoxyalkoxypsoralens and methods for selective inhibition of the voltage gated Kv1.3 potassium channel) claiming PAP-1 and related compounds for the treatment of T cell-mediated autoimmune diseases. This patent has been licensed to by Airmid, Inc., a start-up company for which HW is a scientific founder. Airmid has licensed on the PAP-1 patent to Circassia Ltd. (Oxford, UK) for development as a topical for psoriasis. Please note that this study shows that PAP-1 does NOT work in allograft vasculopathy. The authors confirm that these interests do not alter their adherence to all the PLOS ONE policies on sharing data and materials and would like to point out that the Wulff laboratory has a long history of freely supplying TRAM-34 to other investigators in the field.

Both are currently in their second year of their studies and the first one has written three manuscripts. The fourth author has written four manuscripts and gotten acceptance for a one of them. This does not alter the authors’ adherence to all the PLOS ONE policies on sharing data and materials."
