This project contains basic research to increase the efficiency of biodegradation. A major strategy in increasing the efficiency of biodegradation is to optimize chemotaxis of different Pseudomonas strains towards environmental contaminants. In this context CheR methyltransferases are of importance. This project covers expenses for hiring a post-doctoral researcher during 2 years, expenses for traveling and general expenses for running a research laboratory. Apart from this research project there is no other interaction between Tino Krell and the BBVA Foundation such as consultancy. This project will finish by the end of June and no patents will be deposited that are the result of this project. There are no products on the market or will be developed. In summary, the interaction between T.K. and the BBVA Foundation is purely scientific. This does not alter the authors’ adherence to all the PLOS ONE policies on sharing data and materials."
