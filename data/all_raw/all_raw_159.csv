Coordinated between USA and Canada-based investigators: NG JNMA.","All authors, but HJL, YGW and ELT, have in the past received research support, speakers' honoraria and travel funds from pharmaceutical and/or medical device companies, though none in any way associated with research reported here. NG and DHB, are listed on a number of FMR1-related U.S. patent applications. Among those, only one already-awarded patent relates to the potential interplay of FMR1 and BRCA genes (Patent name: “Method of treatment related to the FMR1 gene;” Patent number: US 8,629,120 B2.) All still-pending patent applications relate exclusively to claimed functions of the FMR1 gene, affecting ovarian aging patterns, associated with specific gene mutations, and the ability to diagnostically predict ovarian aging patterns based on such FMR1 mutations. NG is owner of CHR and, like VAK, HJL, YGW, ELT and DHB, is employed by CHR. The CHR was via salary support the principal funder of the study; the medical corporation, however, exerted no influence on any aspects of the conduct of this study. Patient specimens were provided anonymized and coded by JNMA and CBG, based on an institutional agreement between CHR and the University of British Columbia. CHR was responsible for FMR1 analyses of specimen and performance of data analysis. The Foundation for Reproductive Medicine was a secondary funder of the study, and NG as well as DHB. are members of the Board of the foundation. NG and DHB are also inventors on a number of other U.S. patents, some already awarded and others still pending, all, however, with no relation to here presented research. NG is a shareholder in fertility Nutraceuticals, LLC, and he and DHB receive royalties from this company for patents, which involve the treatment of low functional ovarian reserve with supplementation of DHEA and other androgens. There are no further patents, products in development or marketed products to declare. None of the potential competing interests noted here alter the authors' adherence to all of the PLoS ONE policies on sharing data and materials, as detailed online in the guide for authors. Co-author Norbert Gleicher, is, indeed, now an Editorial Board member of PLOS ONE; but had not yet been invited to join the Board at time of submission of this manuscript.
