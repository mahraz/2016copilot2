RJR also hypothesized the notion of three classes of genes. Originally, the genes studied in the paper were described as mosaic genes; however, owing to a conflict with a previously defined structural class of proteins, the name was changed to segmentally variable genes (SVGs), although the authors still feel that the term mosaic genes captures the concept proposed. SK and YZ proposed the term “the adaptation layer of the microbial proteome.” All the authors participated in the high-level design of the computational analysis software; however, the specific variant described in this paper was primarily designed by YZ. This design is still evolving and will be described in follow-up publications. YZ implemented the computational pipeline that supported the computational analysis described in this paper. All the authors participated in the analysis and the interpretation of the results. The Web server was implemented by YZ. All the authors participated in the write-up and numerous revisions of the text.","The authors have declared that no conflicts of interest exist."

Data were processed by KD and PS, utilizing Seralogix's proprietary computational pipeline for biological systems analysis. The relation between Seralogix and Texas A&M University, College of Veterinary Medicine is strictly on a collaborative (mutually beneficial) research basis with no financial arrangements, commitments or interests. KD's and PS's motivation is to see their computational tools produce results that contribute to the improved understanding of host response to pathogen invasions (an objective of his National Health Institute research grants). KD and PS contributed to the interpretation of the analysis results provided to the Texas A&M University researchers. Seralogix has no ownership of the data, nor results produced by their tools. This does not alter the authors' adherence to all the PLOS ONE policies on sharing data and materials."
