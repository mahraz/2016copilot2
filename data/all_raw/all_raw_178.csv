The scientific research was part of a greater project in Niger involving the Germany, Niger, and the NGO Cargo (Touareg Aid) where German partners built a nomad school and delivered food to nourish the nomad children (mainly in Touareg). In exchange for structural development measures in the north of the Niger, the team of scientists lead by the State Natural History Museum Braunschweig were allowed to conduct the two dinosaur digging campaigns in 2007 and 2008.
