Each of these companies provided work for this project as a subcontractor and was paid for it. None of these companies owns any IP, has any control or exerted any influence on this article other than scientific editorializing. Specifically, the authors contracted 454 (and then Roche-454) to perform some of the sequencing since at the time there was no 454 machine in Boston. The authors met with their staff and they helped in the experimental design, but the sequencing was paid for by the authors' institution and the company holds no IP or any other controls. Synamatix was contracted to help the authors perform bioinformatic analysis using their equipment as the authors did not at the time have the full computer capability. They were used as a service company and do not control any IP or data. One of the authors' long term collaborators, Steve Gullans, moved from academia to the venture company he founded, Excel. He participated as a paid scientific collaborator and consultant in a manner unrelated to his company. Like the case for the others, his company places no restrictions nor owns any IP. Given that as described above, all these companies provided paid for, subcontracted resources, not unlike a Core function, the authors included some of their employees as authors for some scientific contributions. Furthermore, all the final data analysis, processing and validation was done in the authors' academic institution. However, there is no competing interest nor are there any data sharing limitations. Thus the authors continue to adhere to PLOS one rules and regulations in full."

Klinikum Chemnitz gGmbH is the hospital where the clinical part of the study was performed. The hospital is a non-profit organization (gGmbH) (“g” means “gemeinnuetzig”, in English: non-profit) run by the Free State of Saxony and the City of Chemnitz. Katrin Engelmann and Ilya Kotomin are employees at Klinikum Chemnitz gGmbH, and neither the authors nor the hospital have any competing and/or financial interests. Therefore, no further relevant declarations have to be made. A patent is pending for AmnioClip, which comprises the clip ring system and the mounting device. The patent was filed on March 3, 2014, under ref. no. EP 2633838A113157162.2 and published under ref. no. EP 2633838A1. The title of the filed patent is ""Haltevorrichtung für eine Membran für eine medizinische Anwendung am Auge und Aufspannvorrichtung dazu"" (in English: ""Holding device for a membrane for a medical application on the eye and tensioning device for same""). The applicants of this patent are Fortech GmbH and Deutsche Gesellschaft für Gewebetransplantation—gemeinnützige Gesellschaft mbH (DGFG). Fortech GmbH has no financial relations to any of the co-authors. The DGFG is a non-profit organization and the employer of one of the co-authors, KH. Though employed at one of the patent applicants, KH is not involved in patent filing or any process related to the patent, and does not benefit from the patent. A previous filing version of the patent from 2006 (filing no. 16417372) named the Leibniz-Institut für Polymerforschung Dresden e.V. (IPF) and Klinikum Chemnitz gGmbH, both non-profit organizations, as applicants. Both institutions are employers of some of the co-authors, namely CW (employed at IPF) and KE and IK (employed at Klinikum Chemnitz). This previous patent filing was replaced by the above mentioned filing from 03/11/2014. The co-authors IK, KE and CW were not and are not involved in any patent application regarding AmnioClip or any product derivative or modified thereof. They do not benefit from the patent or any process related to the patent. Therefore, all co-authors declare that they do not have any financial or commercial, professional or personal interests to disclose. The patent that is pending for AmnioClip does not alter adherence of the authors to PLOS ONE policies on sharing data and materials. All materials used and methods applied to produce AmnioClip are known and publicly available. Therefore, there are no restrictions on sharing data and materials. All experimental and clinical data are given in the manuscript and supporting information files."

The fee was for advice in designing a biomarker cohort study for people wth idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. He is also a co-applicant on a grant for £500,000 from GSK to look at biomarkers for lung fibrosis. AK is also doing his PhD from the University of Nottingham on a studentship provided by the British Lung Foundation. LJT has conducted the statistical analysis for the National Lung Cancer Audit annual reports for the past 4 years, which was funded by the Health and Social care Information Centre; LJT has not received any personal earnings from the HSCIC for this work.
