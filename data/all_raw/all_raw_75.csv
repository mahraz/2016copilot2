This circumstance does not alter the authors' adherence to all the PLoS ONE policies on sharing data and materials. The SGC and its scientists are committed to making their research outputs (materials and knowledge) available without restriction on use. This means that the SGC will promptly place its results in the public domain and will not agree to file for patent protection on any of its research outputs. It will seek the same commitment from any research collaborator. 2. One of the authors (LHS) is currently employed by a commercial company.
