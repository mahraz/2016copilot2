This study is an entirely personal undertaking conducted in a spare time. The situation allows me taking unpaid breaks in order to do these studies and visiting other organizations. In particular, part of this study was done at Max Planck Institute of Molecular Cell Biology and Genetics, where I stayed as an invited Visiting Professor (without being paid as well). The topic of the study was not included into any official Institute's research plans, and no funds were allocated for it. So that formally it can be considered as a self-initiated research with no funding. This does not alter our adherence to PLOS ONE policies on sharing data and materials."
