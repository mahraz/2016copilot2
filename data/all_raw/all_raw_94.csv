His employer (King’s College London) is registering intellectual property on a novel buccal naloxone (with which JS is involved), and JS has also been named in a patent registration by a Pharma company (declared above) as inventor of a potential concentrated naloxone nasal formulation. A fuller account of JS’s interests is given on his personal web-page of the Addictions Department of King's College London at http://www.kcl.ac.uk/ioppn/depts/addictions/people/hod.aspx. JB has held consultancy agreements with Reckitt-Benkiser, Britannia pharmaceuticals and Martindale Pharma, and is PI on research grants funded by Reckitt-Benkiser and Martindale Pharma.
