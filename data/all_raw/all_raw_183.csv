Novartis Pharma AG also funds a retina fellowship at Westmead Hospital, Sydney, which he supervises. Alberto Ferreira is an employee of Novartis Pharma AG. Aaron Osborne is currently with Alcon Research Ltd and is a former employee of Novartis Pharma AG. Shoshana Colman is an employee of Genentech, both Novartis Pharma AG and Genentech sponsored this study. Quan Doan and Mark Danese are employees of Outcomes Insights, Inc., and Chantal Dolan is an employee of CMD Consulting, Inc.; these companies were paid for analysis work. Genentech and Novartis market ranibizumab. No financial benefit is anticipated as a result of this study.
