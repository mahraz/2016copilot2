This does not alter the authors' adherence to all the PLoS ONE policies on sharing data and materials. Furthermore, the authors declare that they do not have other financial competing interests, or competing interests relating to professional or personal issues. The actual patent application (WO2011/126370 A1) filed by the Utrecht University to which the authors CAMdH and PJMR are affiliated describes the use of a recombinant trimeric ectodomain of influenza hemagglutinin fused to a streptavidin tag as a vaccine protecting mammals or birds against an infection with influenza virus. Trimerization of a recombinant influenza hemagglutinin ectodomain is provided by a GCN4-based trimerization domain. The recombinant protein is expressed after transformation of host cells with an expression vector (e.g. pCD5) or after infection of host cells with a viral vector, such as Newcastle disease virus. The strep-tag, binding streptavidin or a derivative thereof, is used for isolation and/or purification purposes. Alternatively, the viral vector expressing the trimeric HA ectodomain is used to directly infect cells of a host in which an immunogenic response is to be elicited. This does not alter the authors' adherence to all the PLoS ONE policies on sharing data and materials.
