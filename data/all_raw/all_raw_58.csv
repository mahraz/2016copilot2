Alia Point ‘Awa Nursery provides ‘awa cuttings and plants to research and educational institutions including University of Hawaii, Mano’a, University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, Canada, and Como Park Zoo and Conservatory, Saint Paul, MN, free of charge or for the cost of shipping only. Recorded ‘awa costs for 2012 and 2013 were $60 and $50, respectively. The role of Alia Point ‘Awa Nursery is described by Vincent Lebot in Ethnobotany Research & Applications Vol 2/i as a site for preservation of Hawaiian cultivars of ‘awa / kava. The first recorded DNA analysis of Hawaiian ‘awa was performed at Alia Point ‘Awa Nursery and reported in Lebot, et. al.

AJS is founder and shareholder, and JMS is also shareholder of Diagnoptics Technologies B.V., the Netherlands. Diagnoptics Technologies is the company that developed the AGE Reader, which is used in the present article. AJS was also the first inventor in the patent used for the AGE reader technology. He was inventor as employee of the University Medical Center Groningen (UMCG), which was co-owner of it. Later the patent was sold to Diagnoptics Technologies, so the UMCG has no financial interests anymore. AJS now works 80% of his time as as employee of the University Medical Center Groningen, but is also the scientific director of Diagnoptics technologies. As such, he has an interest in development and validation of possible further future applications of the AGE reader, such as described in the present paper.
