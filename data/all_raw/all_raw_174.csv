University Duisburg-Essen was funded for this research by Kieser Training, Switzerland. Marco Hagen and Ewald Hennig are employees of the University Duisburg Essen and were not paid by Kieser Training. Andreas Gerhardt was a student at the University Duisburg-Essen and was not paid by Kieser Training. The results of the project were transferred to a patented strength training machine (European Patents No. EP 1767249B1 and EP2005997A1: “Training machine”), which was invented by Marco Hagen and is marketed by Kieser Training (name of the product: B3/B4, Kieser Training, Zurich, Switzerland). The owner of the patent is Kieser Training, who purchased the patent from the University Duisburg-Essen. According to the German employment law, Marco Hagen benefited from a payment in 2010 which was paid by his employer University Duisburg-Essen. Therefore, Marco Hagen declares a potential conflict of interest as he is inventor of the European patents EP1767249B1 and EP2005997A1. Only the patent claims of EP 1767249B1 are implemented to the product B3/B4. Marco Hagen, Andreas Gerhardt and Ewald Hennig declare that they have no further professional relationships to Kieser Training, like employment, consultancy, other patents, other products in development or other modified products.
