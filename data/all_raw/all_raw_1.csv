Hashizume, T. Tomishige, and M. Kawasaki. H. Hashizume was responsible for conducting the bacteria reverse mutation testing and the absorption study in mice. T. Tomishige looked after determining the intracellular activity of OPC-67683 and confirming the potency in the immunosuppressive animal model. M. Kawasaki conducted the studies related to the mechanism of action, susceptibility testing, experimental isolation of resistant strains, confirmation of a mutation in the Rv3547 gene in OPC-67683-resistant strains, and identification of metabolites. H. Tsubouchi and M. Komatsu coordinated the overall activities involved in synthesizing the many novel derivatives for selecting potent antituberculosis agents, and, together with H. Sasaki, synthesized and supplied the derivatives used for in vitro and in vivo evaluations. They also established the facile and practical synthesis method for the intermediates to synthesize many target compounds and supplied derivatives for the screening toxicity test in animals in large scale. H. Sasaki assumed a main role in synthesising various compounds, including OPC-67683. Y.
