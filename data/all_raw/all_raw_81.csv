Dr. Egashira is an employee of Kyushu University and also a founder of Sentan Medical Inc, possessing stocks, and serves as one of Directors of the company. The intellectual property division of Kyushu University is appropriately managing conflict of interests of Dr. Egashira on a monthly basis. In other words, the intellectual property division of Kyushu University is reviewing that Sentan Medical Inc did not play a direct role in the study design, data collection and analysis, decision to publish, or preparation of the manuscript in Dr. Egashira’s Laboratory. Therefore, this does not alter the authors' adherence to PLOS ONE policies on sharing data and materials. The other authors contributed to the present study as employees (Tetsuya Matoba, Kaku Nakano, Kenji Sunagawa) or post-graduate students (Kazuhiro Nagaoka, Yajing Mao, Yasuhiro Nakano, Gentaro Ikeda, Shizuka Egusa, Masaki Tokutome, Ryoji Nagahama) of Kyushu University, and have declared that no competing interests exist."
