Dr Guger, the director of Guger Technologies, has sent the corresponding author an email stating that there is “no conflict of interest with the publication as it was done for research purposes.” There is a small commercial relationship between Guger Technologies and the University of Barcelona (UB). UB licenses to Guger Technologies a system that controls a virtual character that can be moved by the company’s brain-computer interface system.
