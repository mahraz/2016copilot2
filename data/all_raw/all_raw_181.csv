Cepheid, which manufactures the Xpert test pays UMDNJ licensing fees for the molecular beacons used in the test. This conflict has been managed as follows: DA has irrevocably limited the amount of money that he can personally receive from Cepheid license payments to $4,999 per year. DA served as an ad-hoc unpaid member of the Cepheid advisory board in 2010. Cepheid did not pay for any expenses, including no payment for travel, meals, honorarium etc to DA or his laboratory. DA's laboratory received a $20,000 research grant from Cepheid in 2010 to perform a blinded study of clinical samples using the Xpert assay. DA no longer accepts research grants from Cepheid.
