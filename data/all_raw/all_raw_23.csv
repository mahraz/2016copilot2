All centers declare receiving a grant from MVI for running the trial. Author travel and accommodation related to this trial were financed by MVI. GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals SA received a grant from MVI to run the trial. MVI received a grant from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation to run this trial and to compensate MVI authors for trial-related travel. Additional conflicts of interest are as follows: JJA and PAl declare that their institutions received grant from the Catalan government and from the International Agency for Development and Cooperation. NA, CO, and KO declare that their institutions received a grant from the Malaria Clinical Trial Alliance. PB, SD, BG, CK, PL, CMai, GMwam, BO, and LO declare that their institution has received grants from MVI for other malaria studies. KM declares that his institution received a grant from the Wellcome Trust and that he received support from USAID and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation to participate in a scientific advisory group on malaria. MML declares that she received non-financial support from the WHO and the Biomérieux Foundation. PN declares that she received financial support from GSK to present the results of the study at ASTMH congress in 2012. LO declares that he received support from GSK to carry out clinical and epidemiological studies. JSa has received (for the Center) some GlaxoSmithKline group of companies' consultancy fees for other studies. MTa is a board member of the Optimus Foundation, and his institution is reimbursed for his activities on the scientific advisory board of the Novartis Institute for Tropical Diseases. He also has received for his institution other grants from MVI and from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, and travel reimbursements from MVI and Sanaria corp. All GSK Vaccines authors are, or were at the time of the study, employed by the GlaxoSmithKline group of companies. JC now works as an independent consultant for GSK Vaccines. WRB, JC, EJ, DLa, OOA, JV, AL, and MLi have shares/stock options in the GlaxoSmithKline group of companies. JC and WRB declare that they are named inventors on patents for which the rights have been assigned to GlaxoSmithKline group of companies. DK, DLe, and BS are employees at PATH-MVI. DSc is employed by the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, and his consultancy activities for MVI are funded as a grant to the LSHTM by MVI.
