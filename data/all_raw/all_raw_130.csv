Joep Killestein and Laura F. van der Voort worked with companies that market drugs for MS (Schering, Biogen Idec, Serono, Teva) and with some companies that have development programmes for future drugs in MS. Both authors are partially funded by NABINMS, a specific targeted research project on neutralising antibodies to interferon beta in MS, established by the European Commission under its 6th Framework Programme. The VU University Medical Center has filed a provisional patent application entitled “Means and methods for classifying samples of multiple sclerosis patients.” that is based on the present work.

Cinciripini served on the scientific advisory board of Pfizer Pharmaceuticals, conducted educational talks sponsored by Pfizer on smoking cessation from 2006-2008, and has received grant support from Pfizer. Schnoll received medication and placebo free of charge from Pfizer for a different project, and has consulted to Pfizer and GlaxoSmithKline. George has had both investigator-initiated and industry-sponsored grants from Pfizer in the past 12 months, and serves on a Data Monitoring Committee for Novartis. Benowitz has served as a consultant to several pharmaceutical companies that market smoking cessation medications and has been a paid expert witness in litigation against tobacco companies. Tyndale has acted as a consultant to pharmaceutical companies, primarily on smoking cessation. This does not alter our adherence to PLOS ONE policies on sharing data and materials.
