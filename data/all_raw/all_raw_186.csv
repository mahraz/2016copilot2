The patent application is Splice Variant Specific Messenger RNA Transcripts as Biomarkers of Parkinson’s Disease, (#20070087376, U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13/240,821 filed 9/22/11). The abstract for the patent is: “The present invention discloses a method to discover biomarkers indicative of an idiopathic neurodegenerative disease in a mammalian subject and biomarkers indicative of an idiopathic neurodegenerative disease in the mammalian subject. The biomarker comprises a splice variant mRNA of a precursor-messenger RNA (pre-mRNA) transcript of a gene in the mammalian subject wherein (a) the ratio of the amount of the splice variant mRNA to the amount of another splice variant mRNA of the same precursor-messenger RNA (pre-mRNA) transcript of the same gene is different in the mammalian subject having the neurodegenerative disease as compared to that of a control without the disease; or (b) the ratio of the amount of the splice variant mRNA to the amount of total 18S RNA is different in the mammalian subject having the neurodegenerative disease as compared to that of a control without the disease. The biomarkers can be used to diagnose neurodegenerative diseases in the subject.” One pending grant entitled “Spice Variant Risk Markers for Progressive Supranuclear Palsy” is submitted to the CurePSP Foundation. The goal of this grant is to evaluate the potential of 6 risk markers for improving the diagnosis of PSP patients and whether additional candidate markers identified in a previous study may be useful for the diagnosis of PSP. The second grant application entitled “Splice Variant Biomarkers for Parkinson’s Disease” was submitted to the Department of Defense. The goal of these studies are to test the hypothesis that the biomarkers will be useful for identifying individuals at risk for PD and identify signaling pathways that are disrupted in PD.
