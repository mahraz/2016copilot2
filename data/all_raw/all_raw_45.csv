CF appears as co-inventor on the patent “Methods and devices for treating pulmonary vasoconstriction and asthma”, US patent no 5,485,827 dated 1996. CF also appears on another patent with same title, US patent nr 5,873,359 and dated 1999. Both these patents have ""The General Hospital Corporation, Charlestown, MA, USA"" as assignee. As inventor CF participates in a royalty-sharing programme, handled by Partners Inc, Boston, MA, USA. Extensions of these patents to other countries have taken place. CF controls the Swedish company ‘Claes Frostell Research & Consulting AB’, that receives royalty and consulting fees. This study is partly funded by Claes Frostell Research & Consulting AB. CF has acted as a part-time consultant to industry (first to AGA AB, then later to Linde Gas Therapeutics) for several years in getting iNO registered as a drug, mainly in the European Union (2001).

The part time work for IC has been scrutinized and is approved by Karolinska Institutet and is in line with the policies for this Governmental body in Sweden. IC which is a unique Swedish forum focusing on complementary, alternative (CAM) and integrative care. The authors conduct research, training and communication activities. The homepage features current policy news, research news and their own service for critical analysis of CAM news in the mass media, CritiCAM. IC seek to contribute to evidence-based health and health care development, including relevant elements of proven complementary, alternative and integrative medicine according to WHO recommendations. The primary target groups are certified health care professionals and decision-makers in Sweden. They do not provide individual patients with medical health care or advice but refer them to their respective physicians. Neither do they supply treatment recommendations in any way. Importantly, the statues for this Non-profit, Charitable Research Foundation, IC, to which they are only accountable to according to Swedish Law, states that they must carry out independent research. Hence, the authors' financing bodies can not and may not influence them in any way. This does not alter the authors' adherence to PLOS ONE policies on sharing data and materials."
