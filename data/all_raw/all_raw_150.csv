Dr. Szymkowski's role on this project was to provide council on dosing and to provide a background on XPro1595's unique mechanism of action. Dr. Szymkowski played no role in data collection or statistical comparisons. Because the neuroscience field is outside his area of expertise, he did not provide any council or shade any interpretation of XPro1595's effects on neurologic function. For these reasons, the authors that Dr. Szymkowski's status as an author for this study is appropriate and in no way compromised or biased the experimental results or interpretations.
