A co-author also possesses a patent granted more than five years ago (‘Isolated strains of Staphylococcus aureus and vaccines manufactured therefrom’, US Patent number 6,544,529 B1, issued to Z Trainin, G Leitner, and E Liubashewsky on April 3, 2003). In addition, two patent applications were filed four or more years ago on AL Rivas's behalf (‘Method of identifying clusters and connectivity between clusters’, requested by MG Tokman, SJ Schwager, RR Rodriguez, KL Anderson, RN Gonzalez, and AL Rivas [Patent application number: 2009/0082997 A1, filed on December 21, 2006], and ‘Method for diagnosis of and infectious disease stage and determination of treatment’, requested by AL Rivas, FW Quimby and MG Tokman [Patent application number 2009/0319191 A1, filed &SetFont Typeface=\"43\";on June 24, 2008]), which are not granted at the present time. There are no further patents, products in development or marketed products to declare.
