Performed the experiments: AN TM RS AMä KK UT AL VL AU. Analyzed the data: AN AMe MU. Contributed reagents/materials/analysis tools: AMe MU. Wrote the paper: AN AMe MU. Performed most of the experiments, including viral and mechanistic studies: AN. Performed DNA cloning: AMä UT. Designed and constructed the SFV replication system (Figure 1A): AL VL AMe. Performed the immunofluorescence experiments (Figures 4B and 4C): AMä KK. Made the initial finding of viral replicase-mediated IFN induction: MU RS TM. Found that increased IFN induction by the viral replicase triggered mutant SFV replication shutdown: AN. Performed infectious center assays: AU. Performed northern hybridization analysis (Figure 7B): AU. Supervised and coordinated the entire study: MU.","I have read the journals policy and have the following conflicts: TM RS KK AMä UT are employees of FIT Biotech Oy. MU is Senior Vice President of FIT Biotech Oy. This does not alter our adherence to all PLoS Pathogens policies on sharing data and materials.","2013","09","Andrei Nikonov","AN",11,TRUE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
