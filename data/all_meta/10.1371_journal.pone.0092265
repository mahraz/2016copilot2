KG is an independent, accredited (in accordance with DIN EN 17025) and officially recognized service laboratory (in accordance with § 14 AMG [German Drug Law], which is also GMP-certified. Analysis, development, quality control and regulatory affairs of herbal products (herbal medicinal products, food, food supplements and cosmetics) are its areas of work. The company consists of a modern laboratory and service centre, with about 180 employees. PhytoLab GmbH & Co. KG does not produce or sell own products. Please, see also www.phytolab.com. Within the PlantLIBRA EC project, PhytoLab GmbH & Co. KG is Beneficiary number 13 of the PlantLIBRA Consortium, as well as a partner of what constitutes Work Package 1 (WP1) (www.plantlibra.eu), having performed the same tasks and activities as the other 5 partners involved in the WP1 PlantLIBRA PFS Consumer Survey (i.e. the institutions included as the affiliations of the submitted article). Their key contributions to PlantLIBRA are as follows: analysis of contaminants, analysis of secondary compounds, safety/efficacy assessment, and regulatory affairs. Within WP1, their key contribution to the Survey work was their expertise in PFS botanical composition (together with the University of Milan), which became essential during the survey data reviewing process. In addition, the authors, in particular Angela Marculescu, Transilvania University of Brasov, Romania, declare the following funding received from the PFS industry in the last 3 years: 1) SC Hofigal Export-Import SA sponsored the 2012 conference BIOATLAS in Brasov, covering costs of products for advertising and travel and accommodation costs of Prof. Gilles Bedoux from Franta (University Bretagne Sud), to attend this conference; 2) Some other Romanian companies such as Hofigal, DaciaPlant, Fares Orastie, Paradisul Verde were sponsors of the Romanian Society of Etnofarmacology, where Angela Marculescu is the President. However, neither of these companies has influenced either the design of the survey, its implementation or the writing of the present article. Moreover, the organization of the BIOATLAS conference had no relationship with the PlantLIBRA Project, and neither did the participation of the sponsored speaker. There are no patents, products in development or marketed products to declare. The above does not alter the authors adherence to all the PLoS ONE policies on sharing data and materials.","2014","03","Alicia Garcia-Alvarez","AGA",19,TRUE,NA,NA,NA,3,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,0,NA,FALSE
