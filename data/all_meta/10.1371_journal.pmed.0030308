CAG, MAM, KCB, CBC, and JMV analyzed the data. JMV enrolled patients. CAG, MAM, DCR, KCB, CBC, ERS, RHG, EGH, and JMV contributed to writing the paper. KCBs role in preparation of this work also included creation of laboratory and spatial data maps, analysis of geospatial and visualization data, and writing and editing drafts. CDC conducted nested PCRs from DNA extracted from water samples and ran gels. CDC then cloned samples, performed real-time PCR experiments on the clones, submitted samples for sequencing, and finally edited and analyzed the sequences. ERS contributed to setup of the urban and rural components of the study, collection of samples, and running of preliminary PCR. EGH added substantial contributions to later versions of the paper.","The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.","2006","08","Christian A Ganoza","CAG",9,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
