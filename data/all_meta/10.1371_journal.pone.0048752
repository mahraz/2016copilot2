Carried out studies on intracerebral convection enhanced delivery of cisplatin in tumor bearing rats which laid the groundwork for the present study: HE.","The neurotoxicity data relating to Lipoplatin™ is manufactured by Regulon, Inc. Dr. Teni Boulikas, a co-author of this manuscript, is Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer. The authors data provide a very strong cautionary note regarding its intracerebral delivery. In other words, it does not support this route of administration for the drug, Lipoplatin™. Based on ongoing clinical trials, it appears to have a number of significant advantages over the free drug cisplatin, when administered intravenously. The fact that Dr. Boulikas is Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Regulon, Inc. does not alter the authors adherence to all the PLOS ONE policies on sharing data and materials.","2012","11","Tianyao Huo","TH",11,TRUE,NA,7,8,6,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,0,NA,FALSE
