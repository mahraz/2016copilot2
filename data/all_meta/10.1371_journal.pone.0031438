MX/a/2009/013417, filed on 09/DEC/2009). MAMG, MTY, RW are listed in this application as inventors. However, according to ITESMs policy, none of the authors is eligible to receive benefits from potential commercial exploitation. All reagents - including the stain Uniblue A - are available from providers such as Sigm-Aldrich without restrictions. The authors only used software, which is either installed by default on the mass spectrometry devices or which can be obtained for free. For the data evaluation the authors took special care and only used freely available software and open community standards (the references are included in the manuscript). In case of the approval of the patent, the commercial use of invention might become restricted in the territory of Mexico; especially the preparation and commercialization of a respective kit. However, an international patent application was not filed; the deadline for an international application passed December 2010. This does not alter the authors adherence to all the PLoS ONE policies on sharing data and materials.","2012","02","Marco A Mata-Gómez","MAMG",5,TRUE,2,4,2,2,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,0,NA,FALSE
