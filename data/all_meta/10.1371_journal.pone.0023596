JPS holds more than 50 patent applications related to sGC stimulators, such as BAY 41-2272, and sGC activators, such as BAY 58-2667. Details of which are available on request. The sGC stimulator riociguat (BAY 63-2521) and the sGC activator cinaciguat (BAY 58-2667) are currently in clinical development.
