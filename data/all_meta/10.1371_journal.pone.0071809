Performed the experiments: JR GMP FCA JMR. Analyzed the data: JR GMP FCA JMR. Wrote the paper: JR GMP DAB.","For this work, the authors used transgenic mice with a functional disruption to the KCNQ2 gene, previously described by Watanabe et al (2000: J. Neurochem., 75, 28â€33), and supplied to the authors by the Japan Tobacco Inc. By agreement with the latter, the authors experiments were restricted to sympathetic neurons, and (for experiments in which both KCNQ2 genes were disrupted) further restricted to late-stage mouse embryos because of their non-viability after birth. This does not alter the authors adherence to all the PLOS ONE policies on sharing data and materials.","2013","08","Jon Robbins","JR",5,TRUE,3,4,4,3,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,0,NA,FALSE
