HMGU researchers did not receive any financial advantages (e.g., consultancy fees) from any of these companies. Co-authorship has been offered to the following members of these companies solely for the value of their scientific input in the interpretation of the data, which was provided free of charge: David Chang, Chenomx Inc.; Michael V.
