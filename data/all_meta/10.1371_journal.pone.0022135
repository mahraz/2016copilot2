Obtained cDNA for GLT1: MJC.","The authors have read the journals policy and have the following conflicts: Greg Gerhardt owns Quanteon, LLC which manufactures the microelectrodes used for in vivo amperometry studies. Dr. Gerhardt is also a professor at the University of Kentucky and a long time collaborator. The microelectrodes used in the study were purchased from Quanteon, LLC because it is the only company that makes these electrodes. The electrodes are available to any researcher for purchase. This does not alter the authors adherence to all the PLoS ONE policies on sharing data and materials.","2011","08","Brandon K Harvey","BKH",10,TRUE,4,6,6,6,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,0,NA,FALSE
