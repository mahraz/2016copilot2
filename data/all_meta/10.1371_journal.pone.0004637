Performed the experiments: ED FP CE KC NB ND EB. Analyzed the data: ED NB ND EB. Contributed reagents/materials/analysis tools: ED FP CE KC NB ND ND EB. Wrote the paper: ED PH ND EB. Discussed the improvement of the design as the tools (viral vectors) also evolved during the progress of the study: EB ED. Performed many immunohistochemistry: FP ED. Help to process the brain (perfusion, freezing, sectionning etc…): FP. Preformed a lot of stereotactic injections in biosafety level 3 labs to develop this rat model: CE EB NB KC ED. Did a lot of surgery, the first but key phase of these experiments: KC CE. Helped perform stereotaxic surgery and brain processing: NB. Developed together a quite sophisticated method to detect and count agregates using microscope equipped with an automated acquisition and analysis system: NB EB. Key component of the present study: ND. In charge of the production of the lentiviral vectors: ND. Performed the production of viral vectors which for in vivo experiment is a tough job and require skills and years of practice: ND. Discussed the design of the experiments: PH ND EB. Worked on the writing of the draft: PH ND EB. Helped a lot in convincing our institution to support our work in general: PH. Was much involved in the entire study: ND. Supervised Noelle Dufour and is director of the viral vector production lab: ND. Shared her expertise in the field of Huntington's disease and help to improve the experiments and the manuscript too: ND.","The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.","2009","02","Elsa Diguet","ED",9,FALSE,4,7,4,4,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,0,NA,FALSE
