TA, ECL, LABJ, MW, DL, and XM collected data or did experiments for the study. TA helped generate recombinant IL-32. LABJ participated in IL-32 expression of PBMCs after exposure to LPS and MTB. MW participated in the immunocytochemistry for IL-32 staining in PBMCs treated with different stimuli and took the picture. DL provided the necessary mycobacterial stimulating components and help in using them in the experiments. DYY prepared anti-IL-32 antibodies. CAD developed the assays also. EDC participated in intellectual input and discussions with MGN. MGN, XM, TO, SHK, and CAD analyzed the data. MGN, EDC, TO, and CAD contributed to writing the paper.","The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.","2006","08","Mihai G Netea","MGN",12,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
