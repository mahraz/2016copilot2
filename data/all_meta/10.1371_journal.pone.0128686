Karelson were employed by GeneCode, Ltd. during the initiation of the study (2008-2012). Currently no author of this manuscript is employed by Genecode Ltd. M. Karelson, MS and AM are inventors in the following patent/patent applications related to the modified nucleotides. 1) US Patent US7786292 B2 (“Antisense agents combining strongly bound base-modified oligonucleotide and artificial nuclease”; inventors: M. Karelson, MS and MP; owner: Baltic Technology Development, Ltd. (now GeneCode AS); http://www.google.com/patents/US7786292). 2) Patent application (“Use of oligonucleotides with modified bases as antiviral agents”; inventors: MS, AM and M. Karelson; owner: Baltic Technology Development, Ltd. (now GeneCode AS, http://www.freepatentsonline.com/20110171287.pdf), but this application was cancelled, and accordingly, the corresponding patent was never issued, nor can it be issued in the future. Patents and patent applications are owned by GeneCode Ltd. where M. Karelson is a the shareholder. siRNAs targeting the coding region of the HCV genome were designed using the algorithm developed by AN. There are no further patents, products in development or marketed products to declare. This does not alter the authors’ adherence to all the PLoS ONE policies on sharing data and materials.","2015","06","Margit Mutso","MM",11,TRUE,8,5,5,5,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,0,NA,FALSE
