This patent does not nor or there any other factors of any sort that alter the authorsâ€™ adherence to all the PLOS ONE policies on sharing data and materials, as detailed online in the PLOS ONE guide for authors.

Patent information on HypoE mice for PLOS ONE: Title: Inducible heart attack animal model Patent number: 7514592 Inventors: Monty Krieger, Songwen Zhang, Sharon L. Karackattu Original Assignee: Massachusetts Institute of Technology Filing and Issue dates: Apr 5, 2005, Apr 7, 2009 An animal model of coronary heart disease has been developed where myocardial infarct can be induced by altering the animalâ€™s diet. In all embodiments, this animal model is a result of reduced activity of scavenger receptor class BI (SR-BI) and apolipoprotein E (ApoE). In a preferred embodiment, the model is a result of crossbreeding two transgenic mouse lines: a knockout of SR-BI (SR-BIâˆ/âˆ) and an impaired ApoE expressor (hypoE). The impaired ApoE gene results in only 2â€5% expression of ApoE and a reduction in cholesterol homeostasis. Resulting animals are predisposed to hypercholesterolemia but can live longer than a year on a normal low fat diet. Serum plasma levels can be significantly elevated by changing the animalâ€™s diet to one containing high levels of fat and cholesterol. Within a month on a high fat, high cholesterol diet, animals develop atherosclerosis and myocardial infarction occurs. Survival depends on the nature of the diet and the conditions of animal husbandry.","2012","10","Yumiko Nakagawa-Toyama","YNT",3,TRUE,3,2,3,3,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,0,NA,FALSE
