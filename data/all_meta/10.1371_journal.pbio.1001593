Wrote the paper: SPM WHIM TN LST UG EW.","I have read the journals policy and have the following conflicts. We discovered the lack of efficacy of PTC124 by conducting our own drug discovery programme to discover and develop nonsense mutation read-through agents. Subsequent to the completion of this work, WHIM initiated a partnership with Glaxo SmithKline (GSK) on a closely related project. The work described herein was conducted prior to, and independently of, any interaction with GSK. No materials or support were received from GSK and no agreements are in place with GSK concerning the execution or publication of this work, although they were at one point involved in discussions about its publication. The collaboration with GSK has now ended.","2013","06","Stuart P McElroy","SPME",7,TRUE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
