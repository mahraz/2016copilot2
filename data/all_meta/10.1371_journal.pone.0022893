Performed the experiments: BS TF. Analyzed the data: BS. Wrote the paper: BS TF IVS.","This study was in part supported by donations from a private Swedish company (Apodemus AB), which have had no influence on either the study, analysis, interpretations, decision to publish, or preparation of the manuscript. The donations were used to pay a minor part of the expenses to keep the colony (rent, food and woodcutting). However, Bo Niklasson (CEO and co-owner of Apodemus AB) assisted Sch√∏necker on one single occasion where Niklasson performed the actual orbital bleedings on 128 Danish bank voles, which then were analysed for blood glucose by Sch√∏necker. Neither the brief funding from Apodemus AB, nor this one-time assistance, does in any way alter the authors adherence to all the PLoS ONE policies on sharing data and materials. The authors have declared that no further potential competing interests exist.","2011","08","Bryan Sch√∏necker","BS√",3,TRUE,3,2,1,3,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,0,NA,FALSE
