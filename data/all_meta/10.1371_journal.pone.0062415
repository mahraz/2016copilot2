SED runs a sequencing service center and was compensated for services, PMS is the brother of CMS and is also an unpaid collaborator and employee of ElanTech Inc. ElanTech Inc allows PMS to collaborate and participate in peer-reviewed publications. PL is also an unpaid collaborator of Dr. Seabury, who designed and validated the original CLC de novo assembler. PL is a paid employee of CLC Bio, but owns no stock in CLC Bio. Beyond the collaborative relationships stated here, the authors have no employment, consultancy, patents, products in development or marketed products to declare. This does not alter the authors adherence to all the PLOS ONE policies on sharing data and materials.","2013","05","Christopher M Seabury","CMS",11,TRUE,1,3,4,1,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,0,NA,FALSE
