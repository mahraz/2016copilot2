Fonds Dédiés is a grant from Sanofi/Aventis to Institut Pasteur free for any research topic. Fonds Dédiés was a gift to the Institut Pasteur in the context of the French law allowing industry to deduce from their benefits funds given for academic research. SANOFI was not aware of the objective of the investigations supported by their grant. The grant from the commercial funder for Fonds Dédiés does not alter the authors adherence to PLOS ONE policies on sharing materials.","2014","07","Ronald Perraut","RP",10,FALSE,5,3,6,5,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,0,NA,FALSE
