Wrote the paper: EM GA YR MA SS.","Erik Meijaard is presently employed by People and Nature Consulting International (PNCI), but was not working for them at the time the study was conducted. The work that went into analyzing and writing up the results of this study was unpaid. PNCI had no role in the study. The affiliation with PNCI does not alter Erik Meijaards adherence to all the PLoS ONE policies on sharing data and materials. Erik Meijaard conducted consultancy work for a plantation company (Asia Pulp and Paper-APP) which is closely affiliated with the company that owns one of the two plantation areas in which the study was originally conducted (Sinar Mas Forestry). This work was done from January‚ÄMarch 2010, i.e., two years after the field work for the present study. Erik Meijaards role was to contribute to the forest technical section of that report, with a focus on plantations in Riau and Jambi Province, not in East Kalimantan. APP/Sinas Mas Forestry have had no role or influenced in any way the analysis or write up of the results of the study. This is a pure applied conservation study without any conflicting financial interest.","2010","09","Erik Meijaard","EM",6,TRUE,2,2,5,5,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,0,NA,FALSE
