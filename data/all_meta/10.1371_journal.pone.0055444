Specifically this means that Roche played no role whatever in the initiation, design or conduct of the study and have no ownership of the data. The authors are not obligated to provide Roche with any publications prior to submission and are not required to seek approval from Roche for any publications. The authors are therefore able to confirm unequivocally that the sponsorship from Roche does not alter their adherence to all the PLOS ONE policies on sharing data and materials.","2013","01","Natasha J McIntyre","NJMI",5,TRUE,5,2,3,5,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,0,NA,FALSE
