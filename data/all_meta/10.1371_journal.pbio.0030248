PR performed electron microscopic analysis of pili, immunofluorescence assay of actin-based motility, and hemolytic activity assay. SA and CR assembled genome sequences, performed sequence finishing, and carried out experiments to characterize the plasmids. CR constructed genomic libraries. GB performed most phylogenetic analyses. PEF performed β-lactamase activity assay and contributed to the bioinformatics analyses. HP contributed to the sequencing. JMC provided laboratory (computing) support and supplied ideas. DR provided laboratory (experimental) support, supplied ideas, and coordinated the experimental aspects of the work.
