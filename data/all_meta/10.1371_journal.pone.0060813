Salamero is heading the 9th Nikon Imaging Center on the behalf of his own academic institution (Roper Scientific S.A.S is a corporate partner of the NIC). While the authors constantly receive support from private companies Nikon S.A. and Roper Scientific S.A.S, this does not concern any activities such as employment, consultancy, patents, products in development etc. The authors simply acknowledge these companies who make it possible to use their microscopes for free in an open core facility, for academic research teams. This does not alter the authors adherence to all the PLOS ONE policies on sharing data and materials.","2013","04","C√©dric Lenormand","C√L",15,TRUE,7,8,8,5,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,0,NA,FALSE
