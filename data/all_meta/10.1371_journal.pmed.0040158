EC, LEJ, and MR studied the effects of glucose and insulin on TXNIP expression in the human adipocyte cell line and carried out the real-time PCR studies of TXNIP, G0S2, and BCL6. WAC, PCS, MJM, and RTL performed the glucose uptake studies in 3T3-L1 cells following genetic manipulation of Txnip expression. HS, PP, CBJ, and AV were responsible for the clinical and metabolic studies including the hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp studies. RS and DA were responsible for the genetic association studies. CL performed the microarray experiments. AK, MB, and JRZ performed glucose uptake studies in human skeletal muscle cells following siRNA of TXNIP. HT provided the human adipocyte cell line and was involved in planning the experiments studying the effect of glucose and insulin on TXNIP expression in these cells. LCG and VKM conceived the project, designed the study, and jointly supervised all phases of the study as well as the drafting of the manuscript.","HT is employed at Novo Nordisk A/S, Denmark and owns a minor amount of employers stock in this Company.
