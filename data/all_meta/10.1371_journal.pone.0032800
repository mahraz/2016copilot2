The work by coauthors JB and MAR (employees of the FBI Laboratory), was funded by the FBI Laboratory. There are no patents, products in development or marketed products to declare. This does not alter the authors' adherence to all the PLoS ONE policies on sharing data and materials, as detailed online in the guide for authors. The relevant forensic science community is relatively small and the proposed reviewers are colleagues whose work the authors highly regard. The authors declare no financial interest with any of these reviewers; however, some authors are working on the same working groups (professional committees) as the proposed reviewers.","2012","03","Bradford T Ulery","BTU",4,TRUE,4,4,4,4,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,0,NA,FALSE
