Levine is co-inventor of the CVD 103-HgR oral cholera vaccine and co-holder of related patents. At present CVD 103-HgR is not available commercially. However, PaxVax, a vaccine manufacturer in San Diego, CA, USA, has initiated a clinical development program to re-commercialize CVD 103-HgR (as VibrioVax®) and return it to market as a licensed vaccine within the next few years. There are no further patents, products in development or marketed products to declare.
