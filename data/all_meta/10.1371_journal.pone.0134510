PATH designed and developed the SILCS diaphragm with support from USAID and other donors. PATH has two patents related to the SILCS diaphragm: Contraceptive Diaphragm, US Patent #5771900, and Diaphragm Having a Polymeric Spring Member with Non-Uniform Bending Characteristics, Patent #2045369, which has been issued in France, Germany, UK and China, and is pending in India and Brazil. In 2010 PATH licensed the SILCS technology and related patents for commercialization to Kessel medintim GmbH. PATH has a limited royalty interest in the commercial sales of the SILCS diaphragm to support advocacy for adoption of the SILCS diaphragm in low-resource settings. The PATH authors have no financial interest in SILCS based on the patents or sales. The other authors(s) declare that they have no competing interests. Although there is a patent relating to material pertinent to this article, this does not alter the authors adherence to PLOS ONE policies on sharing data and materials.","2015","08","Aur√©lia L√©pine","A√L√",5,FALSE,3,2,1,4,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,0,NA,FALSE
