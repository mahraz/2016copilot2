CF appears as co-inventor on the patent ‚ÄúMethods and devices for treating pulmonary vasoconstriction and asthma‚Äù, US patent no 5,485,827 dated 1996. CF also appears on another patent with same title, US patent nr 5,873,359 and dated 1999. Both these patents have The General Hospital Corporation, Charlestown, MA, USA as assignee. As inventor CF participates in a royalty-sharing programme, handled by Partners Inc, Boston, MA, USA. Extensions of these patents to other countries have taken place. CF controls the Swedish company ‚ÄòClaes Frostell Research & Consulting AB‚Äô, that receives royalty and consulting fees. This study is partly funded by Claes Frostell Research & Consulting AB. CF has acted as a part-time consultant to industry (first to AGA AB, then later to Linde Gas Therapeutics) for several years in getting iNO registered as a drug, mainly in the European Union (2001). AGA AB is owned by Linde. There are no further patents, products in development or marketed products to declare. This does not alter the authors adherence to all the PLoS ONE policies on sharing data and materials.","2014","05","Sofie Paues G√∂ranson","SPG√",10,TRUE,5,5,5,5,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,0,NA,FALSE
