The VS120 WSI scanning system was used. Yoshihiro Kawano and Christopher Higgins are employed by Olympus America, Yasuhito Yamamoto by Olympus Corporation and Tobias Schilling by Olympus Soft Imaging Solutions GmbH. Thomas Geer of Olympus America provided advice and counsel and Tatsuo Nirei of Olympus Engineering prepared the prototype stage modifications used in this study. Lorne D. Davies, Olympus America Inc. and I have filed a US patent application entitled: WIDE FIELD MICROSCOPIC IMAGING SYSTEM AND METHOD (publication number US2012/0092477 published on April 19 2012, date of filing October 18, 2010). Olympus Corporation introduced a darkfield illuminator in October 2012. However, this commercially available product is not the same as our prototype. There are no further patents, products in development or marketed products to declare. This does not alter the authors adherence to all the PLOS ONE policies on sharing data and materials, as detailed online in the guide for authors.","2013","03","Yoshihiro Kawano","YK",8,TRUE,4,3,5,6,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,0,NA,FALSE
