This award was to investigate complement factor H in the prediction or pathogenesis of age-related macular disease or coronary heart disease. The award is now closed. The DNA extraction for TPT study (for which Professor Hingorani provided free advice to colleagues at University College London (London, UK) on the design and analysis of pharmacogenetic studies including an analysis of Lp(a) genotype as a predictor of aspirin response) was funded by Celera through a contract with University College London and Medical Research Council (who funded the original TPT trial). Professor Hingorani has provided non-remunerated advice to the Roche Actemra Cardiovascular Advisory Board. All other co-authors report no conflicts of interest. This does not alter the authors adherence to all the PLOS ONE policies on sharing data and materials.","2013","10","Danny W K Lum","DWKL",4,TRUE,2,3,2,4,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,0,NA,FALSE
