Joep Killestein and Laura F. van der Voort worked with companies that market drugs for MS (Schering, Biogen Idec, Serono, Teva) and with some companies that have development programmes for future drugs in MS. Both authors are partially funded by NABINMS, a specific targeted research project on neutralising antibodies to interferon beta in MS, established by the European Commission under its 6th Framework Programme. The VU University Medical Center has filed a provisional patent application entitled Means and methods for classifying samples of multiple sclerosis patients. that is based on the present work. LB, CP and CV are listed as co-inventors on that provisional patent application.","2008","04","Lisa G M van Baarsen","LGMVB",9,TRUE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
