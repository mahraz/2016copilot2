This does not alter their adherence to all the PLOS ONE policies on sharing data and materials. Dolphin Energy provided funding to the Emirates Wildlife Society-World Wide Fund for Nature (EWS-WWF) for which the National Coral Reef Institute at Nova Southeastern Universitys Oceanographic Center provided technical expertise. The authors were employees of Nova Southeastern University through which the research efforts described within the manuscript continued well beyond the Dolphin Energy project.","2013","08","Kristi A Foster","KAF",2,TRUE,2,2,1,2,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,0,NA,FALSE
