The following authors are employed by the U.S. Navy: David Moretti and Nancy DiMarzio. Their primary involvement was in designing, installing, and helping to operate the passive acoustic marine mammal monitoring system at the AUTEC range; providing the sound sources used in the experiments; and with analyzing and writing up the data. The following authors are employed by a commercial marine mammal consultancy (SMRU Ltd): Enrico Pirotta, Gordon Hastie and Nicola Quick. The following authors have been asked by the U.S. Department of Justice to act as expert witnesses in cases involving the effects of naval sonar on marine mammals: Peter Tyack. Peter Tyack is also a member of Natural Resources Defense Council, which is an advocacy organization that has sued the Navy concerning effects of sonar on marine mammals.
