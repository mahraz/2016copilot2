Designed and built artificial foot: SHC.","S.H.C. is part-owner of Intelligent Prosthetic Systems L.L.C., which was incorporated to perform research and development on the energy-recycling technology reported in this manuscript. None of the data presented here is proprietary, however the design of the artificial foot is partially covered by US Provisional Patent no. 60/705,019. Foot prostheses based on this technology are under development, but none are currently available as marketed products. We will make available all data used to reach the conclusions presented in this study.","2010","02","Steven H Collins","SHC",2,TRUE,2,1,1,2,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,0,NA,FALSE
