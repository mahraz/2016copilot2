Geiter was employed by Aeras at the time of the initiation of this study and he was involved in our studys conceptualization and design while there. He then moved to Otsuka Pharmaceutical Development and Commercialization, Inc. which is his current affiliation. Otsuka was not involved in any way in the funding, design, implementation or write-up of our study. Nor were any products associated with Otsuka involved or utilized in any way in the authors study. Thus, from our point of view, although Dr. Geiter is currently employed by Otsuka, there is no competing interest related this publication that involves Otsuka. Thus, this does not alter the authors adherence to all the PLOS ONE policies on sharing data and materials.","2013","03","Hassan Mahomed","HM",13,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
