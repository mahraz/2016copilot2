Bollag is an inventor on a patent (No. 8,808,715) entitled “Methods and Compositions for Modulating Keratinocyte Function” (USSN 12/164,021) for the use of phosphatidylglycerol species to normalize keratinocyte function submitted by Georgia Regents University. At the time of the collection of the reported data, Apeliotus Technologies, Inc., through its Chief Executive Officer John G. Edwards, licensed this technology and employed Dr. Bollag part-time to oversee this research as part of a National Institutes of Health Small Business Technology Transfer award (#AR55022). However, subsequently, Apeliotus Technologies relinquished its license of the intellectual property, for which patent protection continues to be sought by Georgia Regents University.
