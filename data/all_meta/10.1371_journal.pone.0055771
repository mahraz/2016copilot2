Several patents and patent applications on magnetic stimulation are licensed to Rogue Research. AVP has recently received patent royalties (through Columbia University) and research support (through Duke University) from Rogue Research Inc. and equipment donations from Magstim Co., MagVenture A/S, and ANS/St. Jude Medical. None of those requested this work, had any influence on the study design, data collection and analysis, decision to publish, or preparation of the manuscript. Furthermore, the patents do not cover nor limit the results or techniques described in this paper. Therefore, the declared conflicts of interest do not alter the authors adherence to the PLOS ONE policies on sharing data and materials, as detailed online in the guide for authors.","2013","03","Stefan M Goetz","SMG",6,TRUE,2,NA,6,3,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,0,NA,FALSE
