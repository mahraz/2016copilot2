Andrew Mazar and Thomas OHalloran have equity interest and Andrew Mazar receives consulting fees from Tactic Pharma, a start-up company that now owns the rights to ATN-658. Andrew Mazar is an inventor on the issued patent for ATN-658. Several US patents have issued covering ATN-658 as well as the epitope. These patents are US# 8,101,726 “Ligands binding the complex of urokinase type plasminogen activator (uPA) and its receptor (uPAR) that inhibit downstream uPAR interactions: identification and use in diagnosis or therapy” (Parry and Mazar) and US# 8,105,602 “Urokinase type plasminogen activator receptor epitope, monoclonal antibodies derived therefrom and methods of use thereof” (Parry and Mazar). There are no further patents, products in development or marketed products to declare. This does not alter the authors adherence to all the PLOS ONE policies on sharing data and materials, as detailed online in the guide for authors.","2014","01","Xiang Xu","XX",14,TRUE,7,7,9,6,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,0,NA,FALSE
