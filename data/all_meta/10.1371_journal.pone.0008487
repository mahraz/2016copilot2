Wrote the paper: WLSL AGR.","Wai Lok Sibon Li was partially funded by Biomatters during the period of research outlined in this paper. The commercial funder was not involved in any of the following aspects of the research: study design; collection, analysis, and interpretation of data; writing of the paper; or decision to submit for publication. An early revision of the manuscript was first reviewed by the funder, but no changes were made as a result of the review. The algorithm described here may be implemented in the funding companys software packages. This will pose no restrictions toward anyone interested in reproducing or building on the algorithm, as the described algorithm uses generic statistical methods that are not exclusive to our study and that have previously been published. No patents have been placed on the methodology described. In addition, all data used in this paper is publicly available. The involvement of the funder does not alter the authors adherence to all the PLoS ONE policies on sharing data and materials.","2009","12","Wai Lok Sibon Li","WLSL",2,TRUE,2,1,1,2,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,0,NA,FALSE
