This in no way compromised the objectivity of the data collection. No patents or products were developed from this support. The interest of Masterfoods was to support long-term wolf research in Yellowstone National Park. The data presented in this paper is public data owned by Yellowstone National Park; therefore, it does not conflict with the data sharing policies of PLoS ONE.","2011","03","Matthew C Metz","MCM",5,TRUE,5,3,2,2,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,0,NA,FALSE
