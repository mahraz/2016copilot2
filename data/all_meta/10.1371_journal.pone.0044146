This study was done as postdoctoral project within Novartis and was done in collaboration with two academic mentors, Mohamed Bentires-Alj and Thomas Roberts. The compounds used in this study - GDC0941 and AZD6244 - are not Novartis compounds and so Novartis does not have commercial interest in this study. Please check the following webpage for more information on the Novartis postdoctoral program: http://www.novartis.ch/en/careers/students-and-graduates/training-opportunities/postdoctoral-fellows.shtml. This does not alter the authors adherence to all the PLoS ONE policies on sharing data and materials.","2012","08","Irmgard Hofmann","IH",14,TRUE,4,4,6,2,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,0,NA,FALSE
