MBP, OSM, and GIB performed the experiments and contributed to the writing of the paper. OSM did serological ELISA testing of plasma samples for C. pneumoniae IgG and IgA antibodies. All serologies for the work were done in GIBs lab by OSM under GIBs direction. GIBs lab consulted on the results, but samples were blinded to them so they were sent on to DLH for analysis.","DLH has received an unrestricted educational grant, study medication (azithromycin and placebo), and speaking honoraria from Pfizer, Inc.
