The authors note that their primary goal in protecting the IP for the compounds is to ensure that they retain a chance to become actual drugs in the future. Unresolved IP often prevents further development of drugs. Nonetheless, the patent constitutes a potential competing interest.","2010","08","Lisa Sharling","LS",6,TRUE,4,3,5,3,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,0,NA,FALSE
