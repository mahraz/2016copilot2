As a basic research, this study is completely funded by the Chinese government. National Engineering Research Center for Beijing Biochip Technology (Capitalbio Corporation) was one of the 23 cooperating institutes for this project. Based on this study, Capitalbio Corporation may develop products in the future. But currently there is no relevant patent or any product under development and in the market.
