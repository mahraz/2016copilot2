JPT has developed, manufactures, and distributes peptide microarrays similar to those used in this study. The arrays used in the study were developed further to a marketed product (His-MA_01) available at JPT. This does not alter the authors adherence to all the PLOS ONE policies on sharing data and materials. The peptide array used in this study has been developed and manufactured by JPT. This library on this array has been extended and is marketed as “Histone Code Peptide Microarray” (His-MA_01) by JPT.","2013","02","Meng-Chiao Ho","MCH",15,TRUE,2,12,10,2,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,0,NA,FALSE
