Analyzed the data: GJ CC YK-W LE DS PvV FK. Wrote the paper: GJ PvV FK. Conceived the study: LE FK. Designed the study: GJ PvV FK. Designed and performed the enzyme assays: DS. Designed and performed the R5 ELISA: CC. Designed and performed the mass spectrometric analysis: GJ. Designed and performed the T-cell proliferation assays: YK-W. Contributed to the manuscript: CC DS LE YK-W.","I have read the journals policy and the authors of this manuscript have the following competing interests: CC, LE, and DS are employed by DSM Food Specialties and involved in the development of the AN-PEP enzyme for gluten degradation. This research was partly funded by DSM Food Specialties: DSM Food Specialties paid part of the salary of GJ. DSM does not sell AN-PEP to treat or prevent Celiac Disease. GJ, YK-W, PvV, and FK are employed by the Leiden University Medical Centre (LUMC). Neither GJ, YK-W, PvV, FK nor the LUMC has commercial interest in the marketing of the AN-PEP enzyme for gluten degradation. This does not alter the authors adherence to PLOS ONE policies on sharing data and materials.","2015","06","George Janssen","GJ",7,TRUE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
