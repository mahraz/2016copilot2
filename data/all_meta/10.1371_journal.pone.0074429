This company discovers, manufactures and sells veterinary pharmaceuticals and vaccines; it also supports complementary research in the private and public sectors on subjects of mutual interest. Ruminant parasitology is one such discipline, and Merial endorses and supports a number of projects in Europe and the world, particularly in the areas of helminth epidemiology and diagnostics in order that both academics and clinicians can learn from new developments and advise on and practice evidence-based medicine. Study data interpretation is completely independent from the company’s opinion and there is no conflict with commercial interests. The affiliation of Andrew Forbes to Merial does not alter the authors’ adherence to all the PLOS ONE policies on sharing data and materials.","2013","09","Anne-Marie Schunn","AMS",7,TRUE,1,3,3,3,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,3,"4;5;6",TRUE
