Arturo Keller is member of the Advisory Board of AECOM and receives a small ($3,000/yr) honorarium from AECOM. None of the authors have been employed by AECOM, and there are no patents, or conflicts with products in development or marketed products. In particular, the authors have no commercial or other conflict of interest with the manufacturer of the nano-scale zero valent iron particles used in this study. This does not alter the authors' adherence to all the PLoS ONE policies on sharing data and materials.","2012","08","Arturo A Keller","AAK",4,TRUE,2,1,4,4,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,0,NA,FALSE
