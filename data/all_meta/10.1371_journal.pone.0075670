These patents are related to precursor methods for the one described in this manuscript. b) The CDC has an informal affiliation with Radix BioSolutions such that the CDC provides monoclonal antibodies for the purposes of coupling to microspheres at Radix for precursor tests related to that described in the manuscript at hand. Radix makes these available to State Health laboratories that use the CDC microsphere tests. There is no exchange of money between CDC and Radix in this arrangement; it serves to relieve the CDC for manufacturing and shipping these reagents and allows for standardized reagents. Co-author Neeraja Venkatsewaran was a former employee of Radix (now at Tetracore with whom the authors have no affiliation) and agreed to make control microspheres for the test as a favor to the CDC. These declarations do not alter the authors adherence to all the PLOS ONE policies on sharing data and materials.","2013","09","Alison J Basile","AJB",8,TRUE,2,4,3,2,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,0,NA,FALSE
