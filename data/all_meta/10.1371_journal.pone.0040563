Wrote the paper: SCS MWG DMF.","The authors have the following conflicts: Dr. Durstewitz, Dr. Plieske, Dr. Wieseke, and Dr. Ganal have competing interests as members of TraitGenetics, which is a commercial company that performs molecular marker analysis with the tomato SNP array. TraitGenetics has also a commercial interest in the data generated with the array since it increases the value of their services to their customers.
