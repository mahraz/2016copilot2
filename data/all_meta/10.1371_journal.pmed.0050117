CTL, JC, SYT, and JFS performed the experiments involving cell proliferation and cytotoxicity assays, transfection, immunocytochemistry, and in vivo experiments. CTL and JC performed the quantitative real-time RT-PCR. SLE and RA performed the Western blot analysis and helped with in vivo experiments. JS prepared the human primary CNS cells. KGB performed the microarray analysis. CTL, TH, and WJF interpreted the data. RHL and MAH performed the measurements of cocaine concentrations in fetal brain. CTL and WJF drafted the manuscript. CTL, TH, TPS, HMG, and WJF performed critical revision of the manuscript.","US Provisional Application Number 60/893,218 filed March 6, 2007: Cytochrome P450 Inhibitors for Treatment of Cocaine-Induced Fetal Brain Injury, C-TL and WJF.","2008","06","Chun-Ting Lee","CTL",14,TRUE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
