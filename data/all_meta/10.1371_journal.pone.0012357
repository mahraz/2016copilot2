BD and LMH have patents related to the antisense envelope inhibitor. At the time this research was conducted, VIRxSYS and Lentigen provided salary support to LMH and BD respectively, and VIRxSYS supported the production of VRX494, but neither company provided research support for the studies conducted in the RPJ and DvL laboratories. This support does not alter the authors adherence to all the PLoS ONE policies on sharing data and materials.","2010","08","Janine Kimpel","JK",13,TRUE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
