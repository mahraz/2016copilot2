STK, DS, and FL performed the bioinformatics analysis. STK, DS, and SP performed the hybridizations, image capture, and image processing for the analysis of chromosome organization. SVA and JSJL—in consultation with STK and DS—programmed and implemented the SVCell application for pattern recognition and image analysis. TE provided assistance in culturing the FDCPmix progenitors and analyzing the microarray data.
