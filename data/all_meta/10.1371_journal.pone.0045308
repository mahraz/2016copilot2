The patent is titled “neoplastic cells grown on decellularized biomatrix.” It covers creation of decellularized matrix and growing neoplastic cells on the decellularized matrix in a bioreactor. It also covers the potential application of the model. There is no company relationship for the patent and the authors have not received any income from the patent.
