AECOM has licensed the patent to Remegenix, a company of which Luciano D’Adamio is a co-founder and a Board member. As a co-founder Luciano D’Adamio owns ∼35% of Remegenix. The patent and the licensing only covers commercial use of the mice and does not pose any obstacle to distribution of the mice to academic laboratories. There are no further patents, products in development or marketed products to declare. This does not alter the authors‚ adherence to all the PLOS ONE policies on sharing data and materials, as detailed online in the guide for authors.","2013","02","Franco Lombino","FL",5,TRUE,1,4,4,1,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,0,NA,FALSE
