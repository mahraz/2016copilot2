Amanda Leach, Marc Lievens, Johan Vekemans, Marie-Claude Dubois, W. Ripley Ballou, and Joe Cohen are current or previous employees of GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals. Amanda Leach, W. Ripley Ballou, Marie-Claude Dubois and Joe Cohen own shares in GlaxoSmithKline. Both Joe Cohen and W. Ripley Ballou are listed as the ‘Inventors’ of patented malaria vaccines. However, neither individual holds a patent for a malaria vaccine. This does not alter the authors' adherence to all the PLoS ONE policies on sharing data and materials. None of the other authors in this paper have declared a conflict of interest.","2010","11","Pedro Aide","PA",16,TRUE,11,7,2,16,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,0,NA,FALSE
