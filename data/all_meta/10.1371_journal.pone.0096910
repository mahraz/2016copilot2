Patent S20120310544A1 entitled “Systems and methods for identifying structurally or functionally significant amino acid sequences” was filed with assignment to the Board of Regents of the Nevada System of Higher Education, on behalf of the Desert Research Institute and the University of Delaware. The authors' universities sought patent protection on related commercial work to utilize this approach to identify selection pressures for the de novo design of new genes and proteins. The authors' academic research efforts to describe a biological basis underpinning this algorithmic approach are not in conflict with the patent application: Marsh AG and Grzymski JJ; United States utility Patent Application No. 12-546285, filed August 24, 2009; systems and methods for identifying structurally or functionally significant amino acid sequences. There are no further patents, products in development or marketed products to declare. This does not alter the authors' adherence to all the PLoS ONE policies on sharing data and materials.","2014","05","Joseph J Grzymski","JJG",2,TRUE,2,2,2,2,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,0,NA,FALSE
