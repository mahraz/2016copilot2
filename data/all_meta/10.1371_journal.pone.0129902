Wrote the paper: OB RC RB.","The authors have declared that no competing interests exist. As noted by the Journal office, author OB was employed by Oxylane R&D. However, while thus indirectly funding the present work, Oxylane R&D did not play a role in the study design, data collection and analysis, decision to publish, or preparation of the manuscript and only provided financial support in the form of author OB salary. Clearly, this does not alter the authors adherence to PLOS ONE policies on sharing data and materials.","2015","06","Olivier Borg","OB",3,FALSE,3,1,3,3,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,0,NA,FALSE
