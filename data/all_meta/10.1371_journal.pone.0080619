Wrote the paper: BAJ CSL MN GVS IDU CF RG AM PD SDV JL RB JMC DUP.","The study was funded by Pfizer Animal Health, the manufacturer of PregSure BVD vaccine. However, the funding agreement allowed us to independently publish our findings, subject to giving Pfizer 30 days notice of the results. Three of the co-authors (GVS, AS, MS) are affiliated to GD Animal Health Service, which is a private company that provides diagnostic services for livestock and carries out the national animal health surveillance in the Netherlands. There is no conflict of interest with the work that led to this paper, given that GD has no interest in the vaccine or in the outcome of the study. This does not alter the authors adherence to all the PLOS ONE policies on sharing data and materials.","2013","12","Bryony A Jones","BAJ",19,TRUE,6,3,11,14,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,1,"8",FALSE
