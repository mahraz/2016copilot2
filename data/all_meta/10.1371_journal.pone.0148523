Nutritional Advice in Older Patients at Risk of Malnutrition during Treatment for Chemotherapy: A Two-Year Randomized Controlled Trial. PLoS One 2014; 9: e108687). AMGEN was not involved in the design of the trial, in the collection, analysis, interpretation or publication of the results of the INOGAD trial. In addition, the INOGAD trial was examining the impact of a nutritional intervention, and did not include any specific recommendations regarding the use of medications produced by AMGEN. In INOGAD study e-CRF the question of injection of erythropoietin or G-CSF (Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor) from any brand is asked at each chemotherapy session. These data are only available for patients at risk for malnutrition who were randomized in the above intervention study. The authors have not analyzed yet these data. The content of the current paper is not related to the therapeutic use of these two families of drugs. There are no patents, products in development or marketed products to declare. This does not alter the authors' adherence to all the PLOS ONE policies on sharing data and materials, as detailed online in the guide for authors.","2016","02","Isabelle Bourdel-Marchasson","IBM",11,TRUE,2,2,3,2,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,0,NA,FALSE
