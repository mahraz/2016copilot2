Some of the studys results are integrated into a software program that readers/users can download and use to determine the light requirements of any given optogenetic experiment involving mouse brain. The software packages distribution is administrated by the University Of Colorado Technology Transfer Office. That office and the authors have decided to make the software available as an iPhone/iPad/iPod APP that can be downloaded from the Apple iTunes store. An Android version and a web based version are in progress. At this point, the APP can be downloaded for free, future versions may be associated with a small fee ($1.99 per download). The websites URL is: www.optogeneticsapp.com, or simply go to Apples APP store and search for the keyword Optogentics. There are no further patents, products in development or marketed products to declare. This does not alter the authors adherence to all the PLOS ONE policies on sharing data and materials, as detailed online in the guide for authors.","2013","07","Saif I Al-Juboori","SIAJ",6,TRUE,6,6,6,6,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,0,NA,FALSE
