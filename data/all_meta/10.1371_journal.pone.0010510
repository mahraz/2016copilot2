Lucas and McFadden are co-founding scientists and consultants for Viron Therapeutics, Inc., hold some shares in the company, and have previously held research grants from Viron. These prior research grants from Viron Therapeutics are no longer funded and were not designed to support the studies reported in this manuscript. Drs. Macaulay and Sun as well as Ms. Elaine King are employed by and hold shares in Viron Therapeutics, Inc., contributed reagents to this study, and were involved in early discussions around possible mechanisms of action of M-T7 prior to the initiation of these studies. Drs. Lucas and McFadden are inventors listed on Viron patents for M-T7; the patents are held by Viron Therapeutics and the Robarts Research Institute (University of Western Ontario). Viron has not pursued further work or patents for the proteins M-T1, M-T7 or M3.
