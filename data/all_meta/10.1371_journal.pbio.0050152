LWH was responsible for curation and generation of the D. yakuba and D. simulans assemblies and chromosomal assignments, ordering, and orientation (including developing methods for comparative alignments and introducing appropriate inversions for creation of the chromosomal files). CMB conceived of and performed the genome-wide mapping of D. melanogaster genes against D. yakuba to detect breakpoint regions and verified breakpoint regions using UCSC whole-genome alignment. JMR participated in all the in silico and in vivo comparative analyses with the support of DM and with specific contributions by YSC, MvG, LWH, MA, and CMB. JMR, MA and CMB wrote the paper.","The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.","2007","06","José M Ranz","JMR",8,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
