Mologic have not funded the project nor are they currently working on or have they worked on the CD20 project. There are no patents or products in development with this project with Mologic. Mologic scientists are co-authors as they have performed the Kd determination of the antibody (according to the methods sections using Octet Red). In addition, Mologic advised the Edinburgh authors on how to clone and use non-commercially sensitive CPG2 vectors for production of chimeric antibodies.
