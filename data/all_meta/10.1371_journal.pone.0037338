Wrote the paper: JCP KD.","The authors have the following conflicts: Dr. Kim, Dr. Dornmair and Dr. Prinz declare that a patent application describing the technology has been filed. The primer set for the amplification of TCR beta-chain rearrangements from single T cells is part of an international patent application (PCT/EP2011/063538) called Identification of T cell target antigens. This patent deals with a method to identify T cell antigens presented by HLA-class I molecules using a newly developed technology of combinatorial peptide libraries. The publication of the technology for the combinatorial peptide library is currently in press (Siewert K, Malotka J, Kawakami N, Wekerle H, Hohlfeld R, et al. (2012) Unbiased identification of target antigens of CD8+ T cells with combinatorial libraries coding for short peptides. Nat Medicine in press, cited as reference 26.). There are no further patents, products in development or marketed products to declare. This does not alter the authors' adherence to all the PLoS ONE policies on sharing data and materials.","2012","05","Song-Min Kim","SMK",9,TRUE,2,7,3,2,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,0,NA,FALSE
