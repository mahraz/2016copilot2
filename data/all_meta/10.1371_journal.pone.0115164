ICF International is contracted by the US Agency for International Development (USAID) to implement the Demographic and Health Surveys, and they are thus potential users of assays like the one described here. Dean Garrett is the author affiliated with ICF International as a subcontractor (employed by PATH) who has extensive expertise in implementing large-scale nutrition assessment surveys. This affiliation and the affiliation of the author Chris Lyman are noted here for the purposes of transparency, and have had no influence on the content of our manuscript.
