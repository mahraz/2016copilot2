The D. yakuba assembly was produced by LWH. The D. yakuba/D. melanogaster alignment was by CND and LP. KS created the D. simulans assembly used in the analysis; its quality was evaluated by AKH and empirically tested by CDJ. An early version of the D. simulans assembly was by produced by EM. Population genetic analysis was performed by AKH, YPP, CHL, DJB, MWH, PMN, CDJ, KS, and ADK. The paper was written by DJB, AKH, and CHL, with assistance from several co-authors.","The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.","2007","11","David J Begun","DJB",13,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
