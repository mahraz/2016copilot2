D.J.K. and A.J.S. are incorporated in the State of Illinois as ProbioTx, Inc. and pursue commercial development of strains described here, with the support of Northwestern University and the Chicago Innovation Mentors program. D.J.K. and A.J.S. are also officers in Gold Coast Therapeutics, Inc., a company targeting mast cells in urologic disease. This does not alter the authors adherence to all the PLOS ONE policies on sharing data and materials. All proprietary bacterial strains from Northwestern University described in provisional patent 61.450,937 and this article will be shared upon request through Northwesterns INVO under a Material Transfer Agreement authorizing non-commercial use.","2014","11","Charles N Rudick","CNR",5,TRUE,5,3,5,5,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,0,NA,FALSE
