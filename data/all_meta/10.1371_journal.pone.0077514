Nevertheless, the authors, as well as the University we represent, all own the academic property for our data, results, conclusions, papers and onferences. This support from an industrial company does not alter the authors’ adherence to all the PLOS ONE policies on sharing data and materials (as demonstrated by the fact that the dataset used to produce the results presented in the PLOS ONE submitted manuscript are already available on DRYAD (Digital Repository). This project was partly funded by AbitibiBowater Inc, but there are no patents, products in development or marketed products to declare.
