Performed the experiments: RK TTS WBK ISK. Analyzed the data: RK TTS WBK. Contributed reagents/materials/analysis tools: RK TTS WBK ISK AJB JWG. Wrote the paper: RK TTS.","NASA's Johnson Space Center has recently filed a patent application for the “methodological solution” described in the Methods section. Authors TTS and WBK are named as inventors on this NASA patent application. WBK and ISK are employees of Wyle Science, Technology & Engineering Group, that serves as a NASA contracting company. It should be noted that even though author WBK is listed as an inventor on the aforementioned NASA patent application, that his employer, Wyle Science, Technology & Engineering Group, has waived any special rights that it might otherwise have had in this patent application (i.e., due to WBK's involvement) to NASA itself. Wyle Science, Technology & Engineering Group is therefore neither an assignee nor a licensee of this patent application. There are no further patents, products in development or marketed products to declare. This does not alter the authors' adherence to all the PLOS ONE policies on sharing data and materials, as detailed online in the guide for authors.","2013","04","Roshni Kothadia","RK",6,TRUE,4,4,3,2,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,0,NA,FALSE
