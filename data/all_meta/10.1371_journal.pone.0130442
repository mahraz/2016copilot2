Barenholz YS TBK ES UR.","This study was supported in part by the Barenholz Fund. The Barenholz Fund is a fund established by Professor Barenholz from royalties that the Hebrew University and Professor Barenholz get from various patents which are dedicated to support research in his lab. There are no connections between the patents for which he gets the royalties and this research, so it is basically a research fund. Yechezkel Barenholz is a co-inventor in international patent applications WO/2006/027787 (Liposomal compositions of glucocorticoid and glucocorticoid derivatives) and WO/2006/027786 (Use of liposomal glucocorticoid for treating inflammatory states). At the time of the study Tamar Blumenfeld-Katzir and Efrat Sasson were employed by BioImage MRI Research & Consulting. There are no further patents, products in development or marketed products to declare. This does not alter the authors' adherence to all the PLOS ONE policies on sharing data and materials, as detailed online in the guide for authors.","2015","07","Keren Turjeman","KT",10,TRUE,3,2,6,2,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,0,NA,FALSE
