SLE, MCM, and BSB isolated most of the lite-1 mutants, although all authors found Lite mutants. SLE and NKC did most of the live animal assays and produced the DNA constructs and transgenic strains, with contributions from MCM and BSB. KGM discovered the light response, designed the experiments, obtained video and fluorescence images, and wrote the paper.","The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.","2008","08","Stacey L Edwards","SLE",7,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
