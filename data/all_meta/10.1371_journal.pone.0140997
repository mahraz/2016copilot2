He acted as the Project Director and Principal Investigator for the Aquatest project. SWG is named as the sole inventor on European patent number 1960104 entitled: Apparatus for determining the presence of a contaminant in a sample of water or other fluid. Patents for this apparatus have been granted or are pending in a number of other countries. SWG and RB are named as coinventors on International Patent Application number PCT/GB2010/050728 entitled Apparatus for testing the quality of a fluid sample and SWG and RB are named inventors on an international patent application number PCT/GB2012/050452 of the same name. This does not alter the authors adherence to PLOS ONE policies on sharing data and materials. Although named as co-inventors in the patents cited, neither SWG nor RB derive any financial advantage therefrom. SWG retired from the University of Bristol in May 2014. He set up an R&D company, Brightwater Diagnostics Limited, which is in a start up phase and has not commenced trading. RT is a consultant that currently collaborates with CPI International, a manufacturer of water testing kits. None of the formulations of CPIs water testing kits are the same as the Aquatest formulation.","2015","10","Robert E S Bain","RESB",11,TRUE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
