PP Tak is inventor on the patent AAV vectors for in vivo gene therapy of rheumatoid arthritis (EP 2 322 638 A1). The current controller of the patent is Arthrogen. Arthrogen licensed the patent from the AMC/UVA. JFW and FM hold patents related to AAV gene therapy technology, but these patents are not related to the work presented in the current manuscript. This does not alter the authors adherence to all the PLOS ONE policies on sharing data and materials. FM, JFW and PTT consulted for companies for projects unrelated to the present work.
