This does not alter the authors' adherence to all the PLoS ONE policies on sharing data and materials. The authors had no consultancy from Hamamatsu Photonics. They have applied for a patent regarding this study. The title of the application is “Rain Disease Diagnosis System”and the international application number is “CT/JP2009/061224”. This patent is related to development of a data processing algorithm, which was used in creating a sensitivity-distribution map in this manuscript, but there is no limitation on using the authors' data by others for the purpose of academic, non-commercial research after publication of this journal. The authors also declare that the present study has nothing to do with any product nor market benefit of Hamamatsu Photonics.","2011","09","Akihiro Kakimoto","AK",8,TRUE,3,2,3,3,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,0,NA,FALSE
