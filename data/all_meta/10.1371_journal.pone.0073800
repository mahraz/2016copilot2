Wrote the paper: EE-I JF JD.","A section of the laboratory work reported in this study (nNOS and Ca Channel bioassays) which was undertaken at the Australian Institute of Marine Science (AIMS) by AIMS staff, was supported by funding from a commercial source - the (then) Australian biotechnology research and development company AMRAD Discovery Technologies. The contract between AIMS and AMRAD DT was satisfactorily concluded in 1998. This company was renamed at various times (Exgenix Pty Ltd; Cerylid Pty Ltd) but has ceased operations and there are no outstanding commercial obligations or issues regarding this data.
