However, he has not been in contact with other PLOS ONE staff with regard to this submission and recused himself from the decision on whether to submit to PLOS ONE and the choice of suggested reviewers. Doherty is also employed by a commercial company (GlaxoSmithKline Pharma, hereafter GSK) but hereby attests that GSK had no role in the planning, conduct or analysis of the research reported in this study, nor in the writing of the manuscript. Professor Doherty’s involvement in the study was as part of his position as an adjunct professor at the University of Bergen.
