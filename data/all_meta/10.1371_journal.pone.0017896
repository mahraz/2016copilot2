This patent covers the mutations used to derive mCerulean2 and mCerulean2.N variants that are the precursors to mCerulean3. Although the authors are pursuing commercial licensing and sale of their CFP reagents through companies like Clontech and Life Technologies, this does not alter their acceptance and adherence to the PLoS ONE policy as well as National Institutes of Health (NIH) policy for reagent sharing. All reagents described in the article are freely available upon reasonable request for the purpose of academic, non-commercial research, which will likely include deposition of the plasmids encoding mCerulean3 in a repository such as addgene.org.","2011","03","Michele L Markwardt","MLM",10,TRUE,6,9,9,6,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,0,NA,FALSE
