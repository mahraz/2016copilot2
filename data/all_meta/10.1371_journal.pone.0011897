In addition, Dr. Hirano has a research contract with Santhera for a clinical trial of idebenone for a mitochondrial disease (Mitochondrial Encephalomyopathy Lactic Acidosis and Stroke-like episode [MELAS]). Dr. Hirano receives no salary support from Santhera. Other than supplying idebenone, Santhera was not involved in the research described in this manuscript. The work of Dr. Hirano and colleagues was performed independently of Santhera. In fact, the results of this study may be viewed as negative for Santhera, because the findings suggest that idebenone cannot replace coenzyme Q10 in the mitochondrial respiratory chain.","2010","07","Luis C López","LCL",9,TRUE,3,4,7,3,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,0,NA,FALSE
