Wrote the paper: AP GT CP GA.","The authors have read the journals policy and have the following conflicts: the research was funded through Vita (Europe) Limited, a small UK company specialising only in honeybee health. MW works for this company. The original studies examined honeybee behaviour and they discovered the anaesthetisation properties of 2-H in the mammalian peripheral nervous systems as an extension to the honeybee biology work. Vita has now filed a patent on the potential use of 2-heptanone as a local anaesthetic (International Patent Application number: PCT/GB2012/050157). This does not alter the authors’ adherence to all the PLOS ONE policies on sharing data and materials. All other authors have declared that no competing interests exist.","2012","10","Alexandros Papachristoforou","AP",9,FALSE,3,9,9,4,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,0,NA,FALSE
