B.J.W. is co-investigator on a CIHR grant with the VP research of GSK; he is on the Scientific advisory board of Medicago and has served on ad hoc advisory committees (clinical and scientific) for all of the major vaccine manufacturers. This does not alter the authors adherence to all the PLoS ONE policies on sharing data and materials. Please note: Although the GSK vaccine was mentioned in this study, they did not provide vaccine for the study. The authors did not vaccinate the cohort but asked the participants to report on whether they had received the vaccine, which in the season reported was available through a public vaccine program, using vaccine purchased by the Canadian Government from GSK. Similarly the longitudinal donor in the study who reports 2 vaccinations obtained these vaccines through the public mechanism, not through the study.","2011","11","Lisa E Wagar","LEW",12,TRUE,7,3,6,2,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,0,NA,FALSE
