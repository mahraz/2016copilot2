PV and MDK are employees of Unilever R&D Vlaardingen, The Netherlands. Unilever makes no claims regarding B-vitamins, homocysteine, and CVD on their food products, and PV and MDK have worked on the paper due to their expertise and data from previous academic life. PV and MDK therefore do not consider this to be a competing interest but declare it for reasons of transparency. HH is an employee of deCode, a biotechnology company that produces genetic testing services. JD and RCo are on the Editorial Board of PLoS Medicine. All other authors have declared that no competing interests exist.","2012","02","Robert Clarke","RC",32,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
