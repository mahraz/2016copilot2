Merrill and Ring L. P. (M & R) and the Lower Elwha tribe fisheries jointly implemented the management that serves as the basis of this paper in 1994, three years before the author had any contact with them. M & R provided the author with access to their lands as an independent investigator. It did not provide any financial support, did not participate in the data analysis, did not participate in the writing of the paper, and did not have any say in the any phase of the publication process. M & R did not place constraints on the study design and methodology with two exceptions: it required that Washington state evaluate the research to determine whether the work needed a hydrologic impact permit (the state determined that it did not), and it prohibited using any fish census method which could directly harm salmon in the streams flowing through their lands.","2012","12","J Timothy Wootton","JTW",1,FALSE,1,1,1,1,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,0,NA,FALSE
