Development of computational method: JBvK.","KWvD and SAAvdB have a research collaboration agreement with TSE systems (Bad Homburg, Germany), who also provided funding for the development of the computational method in the form of indirect calorimetry equipment. The penalised spline regression method for TEE decomposition is currently under evaluation to become part of the TSE Phenomaster/Labmaster software package. There are no patents or marketed products to declare. The research collaboration agreement with TSE systems does not alter the authors adherence to all the PLoS ONE policies on sharing data, algorithms and materials. LMH is employed by both the Leiden University Medical Centre and the Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research-Quality of Life (TNO). TNO has had no role in the study design, data collection and analysis, decision to publish, or preparation of the manuscript.
