SPM was a founder of Sapphire and thus owns significant shares in the company. The research in this manuscript is performed through a US Department of Energy-funded collaboration between Sapphire Energy and UCSD. This does not alter the authors adherence to all the PLoS ONE policies on sharing data and materials.
