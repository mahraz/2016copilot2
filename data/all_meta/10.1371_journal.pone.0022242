Wrote the paper: AC.","The authors have read the journals policy and have the following conflicts: Patrick Revers√©, one of the co-authors, is employed by G√®nes Diffusion, a commercial company that generously provided a significant amount of samples and phenotypic information. However no funding was provided by G√®nes Diffusion, the French Polled Charolais Program, UCATRC breeding company, or the Charolais breeders. In addition, these partners were not involved in the study design, analysis and interpretation of data, writing of the paper, or decision to submit for publication. The results reported in this study will have no commercial application. This does not alter the authors adherence to all the PLoS ONE policies on sharing data and materials.","2011","07","Aur√©lien Capitan","A√C",6,TRUE,2,3,1,1,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,1,"4",FALSE
