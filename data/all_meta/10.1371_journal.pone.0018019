There is no conflict of gfnmedibers company interests with the current study; Alexander U Brandt contributed to the study merely in his role of a guest scientist in the NCRC. As the grant KF2286101FO9 from the German Ministry of Economics was awarded both to NeuroCure Clinical Research Center and gfnmediber and gfnmediber is employing Alexander U Brandt, the authors include gfnmediber GmbH, Berlin, Germany as a funding source.
