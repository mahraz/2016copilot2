The Michigan Economic Development Corporation/Michigan Technology Tri-Corridor provided funding for the development of the LS-CAT beamlines at APS. The beamline operations request all users to print the prescribed acknowledgement statement in all publications describing structures whose data were collected at LS-CAT. The LS-CAT beam lines were used to collect diffraction data for the structures described in this manuscript. The use of the beamlines in no way restricts our ability to publish or share information, therefore this does not alter the authors' adherence to PLOS ONE policies on sharing data and materials.","2014","09","Sanjeeva J Wijeyesakere","SJW",3,TRUE,3,2,3,3,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,0,NA,FALSE
