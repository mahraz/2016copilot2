Washington SeaGrant is also administered by NOAA, however the NOAA employees that are authors on this paper were not directly involved with SeaGrant funding decisions. Funding from this agency was a major part of funding this research. Authors Katherine Ayres, Rebecca Booth and Samuel Wasser work for the Center for Conservation Biology, which also partially funded this work. Author Kari Koski is an employee for the Soundwatch Boater Education program that provided the vessel traffic data for this research. Soundwatch is a boater education program that often consults on vessel regulations decisions based on their monitoring research. This does not alter the authors adherence to all the PLoS ONE policies on sharing data and materials.","2012","06","Katherine L Ayres","KLA",10,TRUE,2,3,5,3,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,0,NA,FALSE
