Analyzed the data: CG LPF DMK. Wrote the paper: DMK. Discovered the complementary rib and nose expression subdomains, proposed the connection to somites, and carried out the transgenic, expression, mutant comparisons, and marker gene analysis in Figures 1â€4 and Figures S1, S2, S3, S4: CG. Tested the effects of local expression on rib morphology with BmprIb constructs, and identified and measured the endogenous deposition and resorption patterns in different rib domains in Figures 5 and 6 and assisted with the regulatory survey in Figure S1: LPF. Significant contributions to the writing of the paper: CG LPF.","The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.","2008","12","Catherine Guenther","CG",3,FALSE,2,NA,3,1,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,0,NA,FALSE
