Although Genentech/Biogen-Idec provided funds for the conduct of the RAVE clinical trial, neither of these companies nor any other commercial entity provided any support for the ancillary study reported in this manuscript. This does not alter the authors′ adherence to all the PLoS ONE policies on sharing data and materials.","2012","01","Paul A Monach","PAM",22,TRUE,1,2,1,1,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,16,"4;5;6;7;8;9;10;11;12;13;14;17;18;19;20;21",TRUE
