Philips Medical Systems provided the ultrasound machines for the GHS and had no role in the current research. Hence, funding by Philips Medical Systems does not alter the authors adherence to all the PLOS ONE policies on sharing data and materials.","2013","04","Matthijs J H M van der Loos","MJHMVDL",68,TRUE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
