The research program forges a link between basic molecular cell biology and the application and validation of model systems in biomedical research. A proven track-record in this translational approach is not only given by the partners from industry, but also by professors with a strong focus on cellular test systems in pharmacology-toxicology, and is further strengthened through a collaborative center on this topic (CAAT) together with Johns-Hopkins-University in Baltimore. The core academic groups with expertise in cell biology are also members of the new Graduate School Chemical Biology (KoRS-CB) supported by the German Exzellenzinitiative. The combined experience at the interface between basic and applied pharmaceutical research generates the profile of the graduate training program. Therefore, the role of Nycomed GmbH is to support the scientific goals of the research program within its field of expertise and to contribute to the teaching program of the graduate school. Nycomed GmbH has no commercial interest in the (freely available compound) tested in this study. Peggy Synwoldt and Andreas Pahl are employed by Nycomed Germany Holding GmbH. There are no patents, products in development or marketed products to declare. This does not alter the authors adherence to all the PLOS ONE policies on sharing data and materials, as detailed online in the guide for authors.","2012","11","Svantje Tauber","ST",7,TRUE,7,4,4,2,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,0,NA,FALSE
