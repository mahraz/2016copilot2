DPK and EE received research support from EMD Serono to their institution (St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital) for a substudy of the present study (not reported herein). EE served as a consultant to Thera Technologies in 2010, which licenses tesamorelin to EMD Serono. For this study, recombinant human growth hormone and rosiglitazone, with matching placebos, were generously donated by EMD Serono and GlaxoSmithKline, respectively.
