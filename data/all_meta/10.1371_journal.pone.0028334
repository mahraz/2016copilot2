Graner have competing commercial interests as members of TraitGenetics, which is a commercial company that performs molecular marker analysis with the maize SNP50 array. TraitGenetics has also a commercial interest in the data generated with the chip since it increases the value of their services to their customers. The author M. Hansen has competing commercial interests as a member of Illumina Inc. which produces and sells the MaizeSNP50 array. The authors J.D. Clarke and M. Rose have competing commercial interests as members of Syngenta Biotechnology Inc., which has provided a number of their SNPs for the chip (these data are already public and released in dbSNP).
