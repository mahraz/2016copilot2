AC produced the recombinant protein. AOGC ran some of the experiments on the switch to lytic cycle and provided expertise on lytic induction. KIF assisted with real-time PCR and analysis of the generated data. VL supervised the experiments in the Akata-GFP system and provided EBV expertise. QC assisted in the protein re-coding and production. JO was in charge of patient diagnosis and follow-up and sample collection. FK helped with logistics and provided the samples from Uganda. MW supervised all parasite experiments and contributed to the manuscript revision. MTB supervised the overall design and execution of all experiments from initiation to submission of the manuscript.","The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.","2007","06","Arnaud Chêne","AC",10,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
