Prepared, quality controlled and provided the strain DNA for sequencing: AR. Contributed to the drafting and approval of the final manuscript: MT AR. Was involved in the research carried out on M1 since its first isolation at the VLA; was specifically responsible for the molecular typing of this strain by MLST as well as overseeing the invasion and toxin studies: GM. The closing of the gaps was funded by research money that was awarded to her at NTU and she oversaw that work: GM. Contributed to previous drafts of the paper and the final proof reading of the article: GM. Conceptualized much of the work, especially the computational aspects: DWU. Managed the bioinformatic research team and has provided considerable feedback and ideas: DWU. Contributed text and assisted in proof reading of the manuscript: DWU.10.1371/journal.pone.0012253.t002Table 2

[19] If the genome project listed any plasmids, these were included in the number of contigs and their accession numbers are included.For genomes represented by multiple contigs the published sequence may still be incomplete.","The authors have no conflicts or competing interests, but to clarify the involvment of the companies of Professor Newell and Dr. Wassenaar they here present statements from both parties declaring their interests. These statements can be provided with signatures if requested. Until 2008 Dr Diane G Newell was employed by the Veterinary Laboratories Agency (VLA). Following her retirement from the VLA she became the sole owner of Foodborne Zoonoses Consultancy, which provides advice to UK and EC governmental bodies. In her capacity as an employee of the VLA she initiated, participated in, supervised and managed the research associated with the isolation and characterization of strain M1 and the delivery of the DNA for the genomic analysis. Subsequently, Dr Newell, of Foodborne Zoonoses Consultancy, was contracted by the VLA to provide the time and expertise to collaborate in the interpretation of the genomic data and publication of the results of this research. There are no conflicts of, or competing, interests associated with this employment. All PLoS ONE policies regarding the sharing of results or data will be complied with. Since 2000, Dr. Trudy M. Wassenaar is founder and owner of Molecular Microbiology and Genomics Consultants (MMGC), which provides advice to academic, governmental and commercial research groups working on bacterial molecular biology or genomics. Through this company, Dr. Wassenaar provided insights and expertise in the analysis and interpretation of the M1 genome. The time invested in this work was paid in part by The Technical University of Denmark and in part by MMGC but no other financial input was rendered. There is no commercial interest of MMGC to any of the findings disclosed in the manuscript. There are no conflicts of, or competing, interests associated with MMGC.
