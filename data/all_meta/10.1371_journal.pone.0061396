JB serves on a scientific advisory board for Avalanche Technologies and is a co-founder of GenSight. The authors have a patent pending relating to material pertinent to this article. This patent, provisional patent 61/486608, “Proviral plasmids for production of recombinant adeno-associated virus,” describes the proviral plasmid, pAAV2.CBAe.hCHM, used to generate the experimental vector (AAV2.hCHM) used in this study. The pAAV2.CBAe.hCHM construct will also be used to generate a clinical vector to be used in human clinical trials.
