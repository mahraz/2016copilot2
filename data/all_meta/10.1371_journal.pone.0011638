This financial support for the surveillance of the pneumococcal epidemiology before and after the introduction of the seven-valent conjugated vaccine is part of Pfizer AG duty to support postmarketing surveillance. Pfizer AG has no influence on any aspects of this surveillance. Also, Pfizer AG had no influence on any part of the current project, which made use of samples collected within the national surveillance.
