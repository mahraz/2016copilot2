Wrote the paper: CAR KLD LGA.","The authors have read the journal's policy and have the following potential conflicts: KD and PS are employed by Seralogix, LLC where KD's primary role is Chief Technology Officer. Seralogix is a bioinformatics research and services company commercializing computational systems biology software tools that are being sponsored by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and the National Human Genome Research Institute. KD and PS participated in conducting certain genomic data processing involving pathway analyses and modeling that helped to provide a more system-level perspective of the host immune response to the Texas A&M University researchers. Data were processed by KD and PS, utilizing Seralogix's proprietary computational pipeline for biological systems analysis. The relation between Seralogix and Texas A&M University, College of Veterinary Medicine is strictly on a collaborative (mutually beneficial) research basis with no financial arrangements, commitments or interests. KD's and PS's motivation is to see their computational tools produce results that contribute to the improved understanding of host response to pathogen invasions (an objective of his National Health Institute research grants). KD and PS contributed to the interpretation of the analysis results provided to the Texas A&M University researchers. Seralogix has no ownership of the data, nor results produced by their tools. This does not alter the authors' adherence to all the PLOS ONE policies on sharing data and materials.","2013","12","Carlos A Rossetti","CAR",10,TRUE,5,6,5,3,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,0,NA,FALSE
