A complete list of FBs patents may be found at: (http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&Sect2=HITOFF&p=1&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-bool.html&r=0&f=S&l=50&TERM1=Francis&FIELD1=INNM&co1=AND&TERM2=Barany&FIELD2=INNM&d=PTXT). In the past, FB has received funds from Applied Biosystems (now ThermoFisher) to further develop the aforementioned patents. FB is currently the recipient of a sponsored research grant funded by Roche. The authors would like to confirm that this does not alter our adherence to PLOS ONE policies on sharing data and materials, nor do the current affiliations of MS Rundell or MR Pingle. To the authors knowledge, neither Roche nor Thermo Fisher has any interest in developing a product from the current study.","2015","09","Sanchita Das","SD",13,TRUE,13,6,12,5,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,0,NA,FALSE
