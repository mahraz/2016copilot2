Apeiron Biologics Forschungs and Tiroler Landeskrankenanstalten GmbH are the company partners within the COMET Center ONCOTYROL funded by the Austrian Federal Ministries BMVIT/BMWFJ (via FFG) and the Tiroler Zukunftsstiftung/Standortagentur Tirol (SAT). There has not been direct funding by these two company partners. Nevertheless and because of this fruitful cooperation, there are coauthors employed by a commercial company Apeiron-Biologics AG.
