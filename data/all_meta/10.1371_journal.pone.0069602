We confirm that the authors Christopher Probert, Ben de Lacy Costello, Norman Ratcliffe and Richard Ewen have a patent relating to material pertinent to this article. The title of the patent is a “device and method for analysing samples to diagnose disease”. The associated numbers are (WO2011061308, EP2010067859, GB0920315.9).
