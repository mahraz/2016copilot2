Performed the experiments: RC AH. Analyzed the data: RC CdV. Wrote the paper: RC AH KD CdV.","This study was funded by GlaxoSmithKline; study number EPI40638. The authors affiliated with GlaxoSmithKline were involved in the study design and preparation of the manuscript and this has been acknowledged in the authorship. Dr. Kourtney Davis is a full-time employee of GlaxoSmithKline Research and Development. Dr. Neil Snowise, who was an employee of GlaxoSmithKline during the conduct of the study, helped in determining the clinical likelihood of certain therapy combinations occurring in practice and provided insight into the treatment of asthma in clinical practice. Given this study does not evaluate the safety of asthma medicines but instead provides insight into utilisation patterns of prescription medicines based on retrospective analysis of electronic health records, the authors believe that the integrity of the study is not compromised. There are no patents, products in development or marketed products to declare. This does not alter the authors adherence to all the PLOS ONE policies on sharing data and materials, as detailed online in the guide for authors.","2013","04","Rachel A Charlton","RAC",4,TRUE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
