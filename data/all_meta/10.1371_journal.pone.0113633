Hoffmann-La Roche and Astra Zeneca. The aforementioned funding received from GSK, F. Hoffmann-La Roche and Astra Zeneca did not support any aspect of this study. Professor Van-Tam has received funding to attend influenza related meetings, lecture and consultancy fees and research funding, from several influenza antiviral drug and vaccine manufacturers. All forms of personal remuneration ceased in September 2010, but influenza-related research funding from GSK and F. Hoffmann-La Roche remains current, as stated above.
