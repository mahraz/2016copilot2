Performed the experiments: EL AK XC FC. Analyzed the data: MJD TMC JET. Contributed to the writing of the manuscript: MJD JET.","Both MD and JT are Academic Editors for PLOS ONE. The authors both confirm that this does not alter their adherence to PLOS ONE Editorial policies and criteria. Additionally, no funding was directly received from Hoffmann-La Roche in support of this project. The HALT-C clinical trial from which some of the samples were derived received funding from Hoffman La Roche. However, HALT-C was funded and conducted independently of the authors viral genetics study, so no commercial funding was directly spent in support of this viral genetics project. Effort expended by the HALT-C personnel in support of this project was paid for by National Institutes of Health grant DK045715 to JT through a subcontract with the HALT-C Data Coordinating Center at the New England Research Institute. Despite this separation in funding sources, the authors included the funding sources for the HALT-C trial in our disclosures to provide full transparency. Therefore, the disclosure in the initial submission was complete and accurate, and an amendment of the conflict of interest statement does not appear to be needed. The authors attest that the funding of the parental HALT-C study by a commercial sources does not alter their adherence to all PLOS ONE policies on sharing data and materials.","2014","07","Maureen J Donlin","MJD",8,TRUE,3,4,3,NA,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,0,NA,FALSE
