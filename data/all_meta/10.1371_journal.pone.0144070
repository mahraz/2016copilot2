CMF, MRS, ET, NM, and TMY declare that no competing interests exist for them with respect to this manuscript. JEP has the following competing interests: he is a board member and shareholder of the company Lucid. Lucid worked in partnership with the National Wildlife Federation, the Alliance to Save Energy, the Ohio Board of Regents (only in 2010 competition) and the U.S. Green Building Council (only in 2012 competition) to organize the competitions described in this manuscript. Specifically, Lucid provided the data acquisition, processing and display technology for all participating schools. As described in the manuscript, schools could participate in the competition free of charge. However, as described in the manuscript, customers of Lucid were provided with real-time access to competition results via automated monitoring technology installed on their campuses. This does not alter the authorsâ€™ adherence to PLOS ONE policies on sharing data and materials.","2015","12","John E Petersen","JEP",6,FALSE,3,5,6,6,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,0,NA,FALSE
