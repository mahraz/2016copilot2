Seralogix is a bioinformatics research and services company commercializing computational systems biology software tools that are being sponsored by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and the National Human Genome Research Institute. KD participated in conducting certain genomic data processing involving pathway analyses and modeling that helped to provide a more system level perspective of host immune response to the Texas A&M University researchers. Data were processed by KD, utilizing Seralogix's proprietary computational pipeline for biological systems analysis. The relation between Seralogix and Texas A&M University, College of Veterinary Medicine is strictly on a collaborative (mutually beneficial) research basis with no financial arrangements, commitments or interests. KD's motivation is to see his computational tools produce results that contribute to the improved understanding of host response to pathogen invasions (an objective of his National Health Institute research grants). KD contributed to the interpretation of the analysis results provided to the Texas A&M University researchers. Seralogix has no ownership of the data, nor results produced by their tools. RE is currently employed by Sequenom Inc. SK is currently employed by the United States Food and Drug Administration. This does not alter the authors′ adherence to all the PLoS ONE policies on sharing data and materials.","2011","11","Sara D Lawhon","SDL",15,TRUE,3,7,3,1,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,0,NA,FALSE
