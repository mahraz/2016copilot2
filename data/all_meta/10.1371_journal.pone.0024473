This scholarship provided a living allowance to Lesley Cheng for part of the period of her PhD candidature. There were no conditions imposed, nor any influence exerted, by Neurosciences Victoria in the design or running of the project, nor in the decision to publish data, or to influence the content of any publication, arising from the research that Lesley Cheng carried out during the tenure of her scholarship or at any other time. Therefore, this does not alter the authors adherence to all the PLoS ONE policies on sharing data and materials.","2011","09","Lesley Cheng","LC",4,TRUE,4,1,2,3,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,0,NA,FALSE
