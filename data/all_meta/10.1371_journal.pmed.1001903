All authors have read, and confirm that they meet, ICMJE criteria for authorship.","I have read the journals policy and the authors of the manuscript have the following competing interests: DCHB and DH are previous employees of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which provided funding for this project. KPK was employed by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation towards the completion of the project, but was not involved in funding the project. KPK is a member of the Editorial Board of PLOS Medicine. CS and EMD were awarded the Robert Austrian Award which is funded by Pfizer. Authors have served on advisory boards for Merck (CS, KPK, EKM), GSK (KPK, EKM), and Pfizer (KPK). Research group authors have a scientific and/or commercial interest in the performance of their methods, so blinded testing was conducted.","2015","11","Catherine Satzke","CS",6,TRUE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
