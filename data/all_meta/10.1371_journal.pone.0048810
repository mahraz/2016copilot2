Performed the experiments: MDK EK-O PBL. Analyzed the data: MDK EK-O JB PH. Contributed reagents/materials/analysis tools: PBL JB PH. Wrote first draft of the manuscript: MDK PH. Provided input on the manuscript: EK-O JF PBL JB.","The authors declare that the study received funding from Sanofi Pasteur MSD ApS by an unrestricted grant and that this company was neither entitled to nor did interfere in any way with the authors research, including study design, data collection, analyses, decision to publish or preparation of the manuscript. A coauthor on the paper, PBL, works for the company Cryos International, which supplied the authors with sperm samples. Neither Cryos International, nor PBL, interfered with the study design, data collection, analyses, decision to publish or preparation of the manuscript. The authors emphasize that their conclusion that implementation of quarantine for a donor shown to shed a herpesvirus is not a tenable solution indeed runs against the commercial interest of Cryos International. Finally, none of these commercial interactions alter the authors adherence to the PLOS ONE policies on sharing data and materials.","2012","11","Maja D Kaspersen","MDK",6,TRUE,5,3,4,2,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,0,NA,FALSE
