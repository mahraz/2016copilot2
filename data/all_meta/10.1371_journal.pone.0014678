Dr. Jie Lu and Dr. Zhengping Zhuang are participants in a CRADA between NINDS, NIH and Lixte Biotechnology Holdings, Inc. (LBHI) to explore treatments for glioblastoma multiforma. LBHI supplied drug for the present study of pheochromocytoma. LBHI provided no other form of support, financial or any other. The structure of the compound has been published. The authors have no conflict of interest.
