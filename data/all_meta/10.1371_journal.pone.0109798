Second Genome is a gastrointestinal therapeutics company with a pipeline of intestinal microbiome modulators that impact metabolic diseases and IBD. The publication of the lists of organisms with observed differences in their abundance between the respiratory samples from healthy and diseased individuals does not influence the value of any of Second Genomes therapeutic assets.
