Their role was limited to providing reagents and running the radioactive receptor binding assay using extracts prepared by DRH and WCH. The prepared samples were provided to JRM as numbered aliquots without any identification. Her results were then returned to DRH for comparison with his results. No collaborator except JRM has a commercial interest in SeaTox, including shares in the company, past salary compensation or royalties from any commercial kits that are sold. JHT provided support in the form of salary for PAT, but did not have any additional role in the study design, data collection and analysis, decision to publish, or preparation of the manuscript.
