Read and approved the final version of the manuscript: HB LG PB MM KA.","The authors have read the journals policy and have the following conflicts: Ridgeview Instruments AB (RIAB) develops and sells the device LigandTracer, which is described in the manuscript. RIAB and Bioventia AB has a financial interest in the development of the Interaction Map analysis tool. The interaction map analysis tool is protected by a patent (see the reference list, ref. 25) but the patent does not cover the use of interaction maps for displaying heterogeneous interactions as in the current manuscript. The interaction map analysis tool may become a product in the future. Hanna Bj√∂rkelund, Magnus Malmqvist, and Karl Andersson are employed by RIAB. Magnus Malmqvist and Karl Andersson are shareholders of RIAB. RIAB acknowledges the adherence to all PLoS ONE policies on sharing data and materials. All equipment described in the report is commercially available, and no patents restrict the use of the described assays.","2011","09","Hanna Bj√∂rkelund","HB√",5,TRUE,2,2,4,2,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,0,NA,FALSE
