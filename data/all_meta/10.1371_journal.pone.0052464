MVDL received research grants and honoraria from Pfizer, GSK, Sanofi Pasteur, and MSD. No other conflicts exist. For members of AMP, this relation was (and is) indirect via unrestricted funding from Sanofi Pasteur to AMP and specific project funding; no AMP authors have individual conflicts of interest (employment, consultancy, patents, products in development or marketed products etc). MVDL received consultancy and project funding, but not employment, patents, products in development or marketed products. At no time was the funder involved in analyses, interpretation of the results or manuscript writing. Altogether, these relations do not alter the authors’ adherence to all the PLOS ONE policies on sharing data and materials.","2012","12","Judith E Mueller","JEM",14,TRUE,6,12,3,2,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,0,NA,FALSE
