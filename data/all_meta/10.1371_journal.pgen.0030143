MG implemented the MSA algorithm and coded the CGH-MSA software package MG, CM, KDS, DAB, and GRG contributed to the design of the experiments described in this study. KDS performed the Array CGH experiments and Laser Capture Microdissection. CM provided the samples and differentiated the cases into appropriate pathological classifications. SJD provided computational insights, helpful feedback, and access to the STAC source code. CJS provided project guidance and support. MG and GRG optimized the STAC algorithm for use in MSA.
