Performed the experiments: JCV BJT. Analyzed the data: JCV YV. Contributed reagents/materials/analysis tools: JCV BJT YV. Wrote the paper: JCV YV. Developed the framework for the coupling environment for the surgical modelling platform, conducted simulations, reviewed and expanded the results obtained and contributed to the manuscript preparation: JCV. Contributed in the development of the core multicompartmental poroelasticity model and conducted extensive systematic analyses for determining parameters of the model: BJT. Led the research, provided guidance regarding the computational modelling aspects of the platform, reviewed and expanded the results obtained and contributed to the manuscript preparation: YV.","Dr. Brett Tully is currently employed by Oxyntix Ltd. However, the topic of this paper is completely disconnected to the activities of Oxyntix: the authors article involves medical interventions for cerebral disease whereas the company Dr. Tully currently works for is active in the field of energy. The contributions of Dr. Brett Tully to this article were completed outside his companys interests, and are connected to his previous occupation as a researcher at the University of Oxford.
