IMS Health is paid by the pharmaceutical industry and governments around the world to collect, analyse and/or consult on patterns relating to the consumption of medicines. Since IMS data is proprietary data, we are unable to make public the raw data upon which we created our graphs (i.e., we cannot put the dataset in the public domain). However, the raw data is available upon request by third party researchers for non-commercial purposes at the approval of the IMS Health Global Health Research Program. There are no fundamental restrictions if anyone else plans to do the same study.","2013","09","Warren A Kaplan","WAK",3,FALSE,2,NA,3,3,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,0,NA,FALSE
