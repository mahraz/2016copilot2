LS, JAL, UB, BA, and BS, with the help of the signaling group at the Institute of Immunology, gathered the biological details of the model and analyzed the correctness of the results. LS and BA performed the wet-lab experiments. RH supported the model setup, analysis, and documentation. SK developed the theoretical methods and tools (CellNetAnalyzer) and supported the analysis. UUH and RW contributed to the theoretical methods with useful insights. EDG, BS, and RW coordinated the project.","The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.","2007","08","Julio Saez-Rodriguez","JSR",11,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
