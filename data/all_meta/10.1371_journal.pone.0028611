EP is an inventor on a patent (United States patent number 7,582,438) related to  the identification of peptides that selectively bind to Eph receptors of the B class, including the TNYL-RAW peptide, and their uses in the treatment of a variety of diseases and for tumor imaging.  EP is also an inventor on a published patent application (United States patent application number 2010015034) related to peptide-based compounds that bind to EphB receptors, including TNYL-RAW Fc and PEGylated TNYL-RAW.
