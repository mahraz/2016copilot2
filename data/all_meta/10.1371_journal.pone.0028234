Wrote the paper: DK.","The authors have read the journals policy and have the following conflicts: DK holds equity in Genus Oncology and is a consultant to the company. Genus Oncology holds patent applications for cell-penetrating peptides, such as GO-203, that block MUC1-C function and the company has a related peptide under clinical development.
