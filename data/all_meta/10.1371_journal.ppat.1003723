Wrote the paper: RMZ SS.","I have read the journal's policy and have the following conflicts: REJ was a co-inventor of the VRP vectors, and will share in any remuneration received by the University of North Carolina from the commercialization of this technology. He also holds an equity interest in AlphaVax, a privately held company that holds commercial rights to the VRP vectors. LJW and REJ are inventors on a pending patent describing the immunogenic compositions comprising alphavirus vectored dengue virus E protein antigens, including DENV2 E85 used in this study. LJW and REJ are currently employed at Global Vaccines, Inc. (GVI). GVI is a not-for-profit vaccine company. Therefore, its employees have no equity interest in the company. This does not alter our adherence to all PLoS Pathogens policies on sharing data and materials.","2013","10","Raphaël M Zellweger","RMZ",6,TRUE,4,3,3,2,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,0,NA,FALSE
