PB reports grants from Cinmar Pharma, during the conduct of the study. In addition, PB has founded a small company (Energeia Biosciences BV, Geertruidenberg, the Netherlands) and has a patent “Method for identifying modulators of BCRP/ABCG2-mediated ATP release and use of said modulators for treating diseases” pending. However, this patent is not related to the research in this manuscript, but is related to (plant-derived) immunomodulators based on modulation of BCRP/ABCG2-mediated ATP release, including TCM-derived compounds, such as Danshen-derived compounds. This does not alter the authors adherence to PLOS ONE policies on sharing data and materials.","2015","07","Pleun C M van Poppel","PCMVP",12,TRUE,5,2,6,12,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,0,NA,FALSE
