Obetech LLC provides assays for adenoviruses that produce obesity and has several patents in the area of virus-induced obesity (United States 6,127,113: Viral Obesity Methods and Compositions, with divisionals and United States 7,442,511: Adenovirus Type 36 as a Biomarker for Cancer, with divisionals). JH is an employee of Obetech. Obetech Obesity Research Center performed the development of the ELISA and provided the ELISA reagents. The analysis of the Swedish samples were performed independent of Obetech. There are no further patents, products in development or marketed products to declare.
