With regard to potential competing interest, Actavis (the commercial producer of PETN) provided the substance and moderate financial support to J Bauersachs to cover animal costs and equipment used for the procedures. None of the authors is or was employed by Actavis, no one did consulting for Actavis, neither do any of the authors have patents or relations to other products of the company neither marketed or in development. The moderate support was granted singularly several years ago. The company did not have any influence on data acquisition, analysis or interpretation. The funding role of Actavis does not alter the authors' adherence to PLOS ONE policies on sharing data and materials.","2015","04","Ulrike Flierl","UF",7,TRUE,4,4,5,4,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,0,NA,FALSE
