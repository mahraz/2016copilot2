Performed differential biopanning and isolated conformation-dependent mimotopes: MH. Performed virion-binding assays and molecular modeling: JDW. Performed neutralization assays: VP DMM. Tested for autoreactivity: PS.","The authors have read the journals policy and have the following conflicts. The Dana-Farber Cancer Institute has applied for patent coverage of the new technology: US Patent Application number PCT/US2010/046353 for Mimotopes of HIV and Uses Thereof was filed on 8/23/2010 in which AMS, MH and RMR are listed as co-inventors; a patent application for Two Sets of Primers Suitable for Amplification of Rhesus Monkey Immunoglobulins Light and Heavy Chain Variable Domains and Constant Regions listing RMR, AMS, MMM and SSE will be filed shortly. Dana-Farber Cancer Institute requires its employees to assign patent and other intellectual property rights to the Institute; therefore the co-inventors have no competing financial interests to declare, and the authors affirm that their adherence to all the PLoS ONE policies on sharing data and materials is unaffected.","2012","06","Anton M Sholukh","AMS",14,TRUE,3,11,4,3,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,0,NA,FALSE
