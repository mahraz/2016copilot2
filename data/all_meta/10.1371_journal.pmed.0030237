AQB built the immune library, and ENvdB and FC isolated mAb CR3022. WP and HWD designed and performed virus neutralization experiments. JAB designed and analyzed the synergy experiments, which were performed by CSWL, CYC, and WP. ENvdB and FC constructed the recombinant spike fragments and tested their binding to mAbs. EvD designed and performed Biacore experiments. LLMP, WEM, CSWL, CYC, and JSMP designed and performed the rescue of the neutralization escape viruses and macrophage infection assays. VTC recruited the patient whose lymphocytes were used for library construction to generate the monoclonal antibody CR3022. JtM, ENvdB, LLMP, WEM, CYC, AQB, JAB, EvD, WP, HWD, VTC, JdK, JSMP, and JG analyzed and interpreted the data and contributed to writing the paper.","Part of the direct costs (labor, cell culture material) of the SARS-CoV neutralization experiments performed with the monoclonal antibodies at the Universities of Frankfurt and Hong Kong were reimbursed by Crucell Holland BV. Crucell was involved in the design, the analysis of the data, and the publication decision. However, Crucell was at no time involved in performing experiments with live virus. JtM, ENvdB, WEM, FC, AQB, JAB, EvD, JdK, and JG are employees of Crucell Holland BV.","2006","07","Jan ter Meulen","JTM",16,TRUE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
