Therefore, although Carmel BioSciences is listed in the affiliations for Dr. Khan, none of the authors (including Dr. Khan) received any financial or other resources from this commercial entity. Dr. Khan was involved in his capacity as a research collaborator at UPEI and therefore the authors do not feel that there are any competing interests. Therefore, the authors are comfortable making the statement that this does not alter their adherence to all the PLOS ONE policies on sharing data and materials.","2014","01","Monique C Saleh","MCS",7,TRUE,7,4,5,4,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,0,NA,FALSE
