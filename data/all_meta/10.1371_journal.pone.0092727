Research in CGTs laboratory on G protein-coupled receptors is funded by the Medical Research Council (MRC U105197215), the Wellcome Trust and the BBSRC (BB/G003653/1). Research on GPCRs in CGTs and GFXS laboratory is funded by Heptares Therapeutics; both CGT and GFXS are on the Scientific Advisory Board of Hepatares and are shareholders. In addition, CGT is a consultant for Heptares. Heptares and the other funding bodies had no role in study design, data collection and analysis, decision to publish, or preparation of the manuscript.
