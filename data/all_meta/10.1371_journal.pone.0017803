B.R.A.H.M.S GmbH holds patent rights on MR-pro ANP and MR-pro ADM. These are EP 03785634 Sandwich immunoassay for identifying partial proANP peptides (priority date: 20.11.2002) and EP 04700013 Identifying a midregional proadrenomedullin partial peptide in biological liquids for diagnostic purposes, and immunoassays for conducting an identification of this type (priority date: 10.04.2003). The authors confirm that this does not alter their adherence to all the PLoS ONE policies on sharing data and materials, as detailed online in the guide for authors http://www.plosone.org/static/policies.action#sharing.
