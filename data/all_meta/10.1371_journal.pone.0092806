GW was only involved in developing and manufacturing of empty bioneedles. Subsequent work (study design, preparation of the final vaccines, product characterisation, immunogenicity studies and data processing) was done by Intravacc. There were no restrictions on the use of generated data. The studies reported here were funded by Intravacc. BTG provided empty bioneedles.
