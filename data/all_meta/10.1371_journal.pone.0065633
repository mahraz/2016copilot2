Martins: JI.","Eric Eichhorn and Boris Schilling are employed by Givaudan Schweiz AG. The results reported in this paper, in particular the substrate screen, were obtained in a collaboration between Empa and Givaudan, which was financed by the mentioned CTI grant of the Swiss Federation to support industrially relevant research. The company holds a patent on the production of natural flavors by laccase catalysis (EP 1 083 233 B1) with the priority date of 08.09.1999 from US 391785 application. However, the results of the present study did not result in the discovery of new flavors and are not connected to this IP in any way, which made it possible to publish them. Givaudan agrees with this policy, as there are no patent applications pending or planned on the subject of the authors results and no products in development or marketed products to declare. The fact, that part of the authors results stem from this industry collaboration, therefore, and in agreement with Givaudan, does not alter the authors adherence to all the PLOS ONE policies on sharing data and materials.","2013","06","Renate Reiss","RR",6,TRUE,5,1,3,4,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,0,NA,FALSE
