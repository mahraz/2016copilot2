QAK is co-Principal Investigator of the HIV Prevention Trials Network, which is undertaking HPTN 052 trial of treatment for prevention. SSAK is an executive committee member of the Microbicide Trials Network, which is undertaking the VOICE trial of oral and topical PrEP. Salim and Quarraisha Abdool Karim are also co-inventors of two pending patents (61/354.050 and 61/357,892) of tenofovir gel against HSV-1 and HSV-2 with scientists from Gilead Sciences.
