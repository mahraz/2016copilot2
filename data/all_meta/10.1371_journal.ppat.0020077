DBW performed the bioinformatics for all studies. SAL and MP performed the human studies and studies on the HLA-A2 transgenic mice (Figure S2). SS and MH carried out the initial identification of ts epitopes (Table S1). MAC, SHC, CSR, and MHC provided experimental data for Tables S1 and S2. MTC did initial in vivo cytotoxic T lymphocyte studies of ts epitopes (Figure 1B). AS determined the HLA-A2–binding affinities of peptides and predicted the H-2Kb–binding affinities of peptides. RLT provided the financial and intellectual support for all studies.","The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.","2006","08","Diana L Martin","DLM",13,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
