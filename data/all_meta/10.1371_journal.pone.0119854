Performed the experiments: HAUR AS. Analyzed the data: HAUR AS. Contributed reagents/materials/analysis tools: HAUR AS. Wrote the paper: HAUR AS MI. Twenty and sixteen partial cds for DENV-2 and DENV-3 Pakistani isolates respectively from NCBI-nucleotide and no entry in NCBI-protein: HAUR AS. All the available 20 and 16 partial cds for DENV-2 and DENV-3 Pakistani isolates respectively nucleotide sequences were retrieved from NCBI (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nucleotide) and translated by using EMBOSS-Transeq tool (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/st/emboss_transeq/): HAUR AS. The sequence for antigenic epitope determination was selected via multiple sequence alignment by using ClustalW: HAUR AS.","The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.","2015","03","Hafsa Amat-ur-Rasool","HAR",3,FALSE,3,2,2,3,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,0,NA,FALSE
