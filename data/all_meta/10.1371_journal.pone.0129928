However, beyond taste testing and quality control (re-testing supplements after periods of storage in study pharmacies) Nutriset played no role in analysis, the decision to publish, or the writing of the manuscript. The contribution of Nutriset does not alter the authors adherence to PLOS ONE policies on sharing data and material.","2015","06","Caroline C Chisenga","CCC",6,TRUE,4,1,4,6,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,0,NA,FALSE
