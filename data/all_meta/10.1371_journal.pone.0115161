None of these products have been commercialized. AN was an employee of Okairos AG at the time of the study. Okairos AG has since been acquired by GSL Vaccines, which now owns patents and patent applications related to simian adenoviruses. None of the authors have had any consultancies relevant to this paper. This conflict of interest does not alter these authors adherence to all PLOS ONE policies on sharing data and materials, as detailed online in the guide for authors.","2014","12","Eoghan de Barra","EDB",12,TRUE,3,1,1,1,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,5,"4;5;6;9;10",TRUE
