However, endophyte transfer was not utilized in the study reported here. The definition of the endophyte population in Atriplex could actually make the patent more challenging to approve, since the population was thought to be much less complex at the time the patent was filed.","2011","03","Mary E Lucero","MEL",5,TRUE,3,3,5,3,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,0,NA,FALSE
