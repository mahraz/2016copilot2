There is no financial affiliation (including research funding) or involvement with any commercial organization that has a direct financial interest in any matter included in this manuscript. While the authors lab does receive funding from a commercial source (SOLE, Inc.), this relationship does not alter or influence the authors adherence to PLOS ONE policies on sharing data and materials, and there are no competing interests. Specifically, the donation from SOLE, Inc. is for the opportunity to conduct research on foot-orthotic devices and has nothing to do with the current work.","2014","08","Angkoon Phinyomark","AP",4,FALSE,4,3,4,NA,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,0,NA,FALSE
