Deming, M. Heise, R. Johnston, and R. Baric designed the study. D. Deming, M. Heise, J. Harkema, A. Whitmore, R. Pickles, R. Johnston, and R. Baric analyzed the data. D. Deming, M. Heise, N. Davis, A. Sims, J. Harkema, R. Pickles, E. Donaldson, K. Curtis, R. Johnston, and R. Baric contributed to writing the paper. D. Deming, T. Sheahan, and B. Yount performed the SARS-CoV mice challenge experiments, the neutralization assays, and prepared tissue for titer and histopathology. T. Sheahan and B. Yount prepared virus using the SARS-CoV infectious cDNA system. K. Curtis, B. Yount, A. Whitmore, N. Davis, and A. West constructed and prepared the VRP vectors and to vaccinate and monitor mice. A. Sims and M. Suthar performed and analyzed the Western blot and in situ experiments, respectively. E. Donaldson generated the phylogenetic trees comparing SARS-CoV spike glycoprotein sequences and contributed to the design of the chimeric GDO3-S construct.","Experiments described in this manuscript use technology that ND helped develop at the University of North Carolina, and that has been licensed to AlphaVax, Inc., for commercial use.
