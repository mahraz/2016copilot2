Wrote the paper: KS CLM MR RM.","The corresponding author has read the journal's policy and may have a conflict of interest related to the work reported in the submitted manuscript. It may be seen as a conflict that the corresponding author has previously received remuneration for consulting or advisory function to companies developing or marketing treatments for MS (Biogen, Merck Serono, Teva, Sanofi-Aventis); however, none of these were directly related to the work reported here. The corresponding author (in his prior function as director of the Institute for Neuroimmunology and Clinical MS Research) has received unrestricted grant support by Novartis, which is developing an anti-Nogo antibody for the treatment of spinal cord injury, but, due to largely negative results, the data - although not directly addressing this issue - are negative if anything for the efforts of Novartis. This does not alter the authors' adherence to all the PLoS ONE policies on sharing data and materials.","2011","11","Karin Steinbach","KS",6,TRUE,4,2,4,4,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,0,NA,FALSE
