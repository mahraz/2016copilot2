In this context the efficacy of transfluthrin against pyrethroid resistant insects was observed and further examined. Described findings will be used as baseline research for further product development. The decided to publish their findings because they see a high importance that might be also informative for a broad vector control community as well as for other companies producing polyfluorinated active ingredients.
