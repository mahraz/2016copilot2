Because Biomet3I provided the unrestricted gift fund, which supported, in part, this study, the sponsor does not restrict the distribution of the data in the manuscript. The authors further confirm that this sponsorship does not alter their adherence to all the PLoS ONE policies on sharing data and materials, as detailed online in the guide for authors. In fact, the microarray data has been submitted to public depositories such as ArrayExpress.","2011","01","Cristiane Machado Mengatto","CMM",5,TRUE,1,2,2,4,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,0,NA,FALSE
