For all authors, the study was partly funded by Bruce Power, the nuclear power company that generates the thermal emissions under scrutiny in this manuscript. However, the funds contributed are part of a peer-reviewed industrial partnership grant with the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada as described in the funding section. The industrial partner provided fish specimens and the geographic framework for the study as described, but had no further role in the generation, analysis, or interpretation of the data. Author Dr. Douglas Boreham has a previous history of industrial research chair positions funded in part by Bruce Power; his current salary as the Director of the Northern Ontario School of Medicine at Laurentian University is funded by the company. This does not alter the authors adherence to PLOS ONE policies on sharing data and materials.","2016","01","Carly F Graham","CFG",10,TRUE,4,5,6,9,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,0,NA,FALSE
