BRO, KT, JW, FD, SAR, WRB, and DGH analyzed the data.. MRW, DM, BRO, OJA, and OGA enrolled the subjects. MRW, DM, BRO, JNW, KT, LAS, CD, JW, FD, VAS, SAR, JC, WRB, JAL, EA, and DGH wrote the paper. MRW was the principal investigator and study site director. DM transcribed data from source documents to case report forms for data entry and assisted with AE determinations and participant eligibility determinations. JNW helped in analysis and interpretation of anti-FMP1 antibody data. JBM assisted in managing the conduct of the study. OJA was the lead clinical trials coordinator responsible for participant follow-up and for general compliance to protocol-related issues and oversaw the quality assurance and quality control process for the trial-related data. CD contributed as part of the study team to the design and implementation of the study through weekly teleconferences, review of the protocol, and provision of advice on implementation. SAR consulted on the study design and analysis and reviewed the first draft of the manuscript. VAS contributed to the design of the experiment and the writing of the human use protocol, and the serology was performed in her laboratory. As the head of GlaxoSmithKlines Program on Malaria Vaccine R&D, JC participated in all phases of the work leading to the implementation of the clinical study described in this manuscript; read the manuscript, provided comments, and suggested modifications; and agreed with the results presented and their interpretation. CAH is the data manager and, as such, checked and confirmed all ELISA results. JAL invented the vaccine. EA performed evaluations of the FMP1 vaccine stability and measurements of vaccine potency in mice in support of the IND filing and protocol submission and throughout the period of the phase I safety study. (These studies are performed to ensure vaccine integrity. This work is ongoing and consists of tests performed at specified periods from the date of manufacture; these studies include mouse potency studies demonstrating comparable seroconversion throughout the course of the study, as well as SDS-PAGE and Western blotting to demonstrate antigen purity and profile.) JAS set up the initial preliminary investigations that made it possible for this study to take place. SKM reviewed, provided insight, and supervised the overall execution of the clinical trial. DGH conceived of the overall strategic framework—of which this study is one—in a deliberate progression from malaria-naïve to malaria-experienced subjects and from adults to children.","EA and JAL have a patent application for the FMP1 malaria vaccine (patent number 6,855,322), and EA, JC, and JAL (along with Gerald Voss) have a patent application pending that was filed by United States Army (patent application number 20030161839). AL, WRB, and JC are employees of GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals, the manufacturer of AS02A; AL holds shares in the company; JC owns and holds options to shares in the company and is a named inventor on patents and/or patent applications in the field of malaria vaccines, although he is not a holder of any of these patents. FD and JBM were employees of PATHs Malaria Vaccine Initiative, which provided funding for this trial. DMs salary was 80% funded by the Malaria Vaccine Initiative. KTs employer, Statistics Collaborative, is employed by the Malaria Vaccine Initiative as statistical contractors. CD is employed as the senior technical advisor to the USAIDs Malaria Vaccine Development Program and advised USAID to provide financial support to this study. JW received funding from the Malaria Vaccine Initiative for contributions to this trial. DGH is the Malaria Vaccine Program Director for the United States Army and acknowledges the monetary support to the Army Malaria Vaccine Program of the Malaria Vaccine Initiative at PATH, of the USAID, and of GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals for the development and clinical testing of the FMP1/AS02A vaccine described in this manuscript. As program director, the success or failure of the FMP1/AS02A vaccine does affect the future agreements and funding of this and of competing candidate vaccines, and DGH has no personal financial interest in this vaccine.
