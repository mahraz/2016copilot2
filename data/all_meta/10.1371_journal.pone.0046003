FB received a travel grant from SIRS-Lab GmbH. MB received consulting fees from SIRS-Lab GmbH. ML was employee of SIRS-Lab GmbH during the conduct of the study, where he had the scientific responsibility for VYOO. ML is now director of Moldiax GmbH, where he has no competing interest regarding this study. SIRS-Lab GmbH has supplied the VYOOÂ®-Kits and personnel to run the PCR. SIRS-Lab GmbH has also financed a prospective study which took place after this study was completed. The study goals and feasibility issues have been discussed with SIRS-Lab GmbH during the preparation phase of the study. ES holds a patent for the LOOXTER technique where prokaryotic DNA can be enriched in a way that a simple PCR protocol (VYOO) can detect such DNA. There are no further patents, products in development or marketed products to declare.
