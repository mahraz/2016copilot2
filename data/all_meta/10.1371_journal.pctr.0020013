BJB, MH, JCM, and WS analysed data. BJB, MH, JC, NS, SB, HA, DBC, DS, GT, CH, KM, and JCM enrolled patients. BJB, MH, RWP, HA, DS, and JCM wrote the paper. RWP contributed to the original design of the trial as part of a committee and entered subject data. SB recruited for the study and reviewed drafts for accuracy. KM did neurological exams/cognitive assessments. PLoS Clinical Trials was not able to contact Carmen Romero and Gabriel Torres personally and so was not able to confirm the details of their contribution to the manuscript or any competing interests.

BJB was primarily responsible for the writing of this manuscript with input from the co-authors and the decision to submit the paper for publication.","BJB received honoraria from GlaxoSmithKline for occasional lectures. MH received travel grants and speaking honoraria from Bristol Myers Squibb and GlaxoSmithKline. The abacavir/ADC clinical trial was sponsored by GlaxoSmithKline.
