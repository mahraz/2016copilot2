Performed the experiments: LAL TPP IS. Analyzed the data: LAL TPP IS. Contributed reagents/materials/analysis tools: LAL TPP. Wrote the paper: LAL TPP PPL.","The authors have read the journal's policy and have the following competing interests: LAL and TPP are paid employees of Osel and hold stock options in Osel Inc. PPL is the Osel company founder, holds stock and has patents on Osel's technology. IS is a part time paid employee working for Osel and does not hold stock options. This does not alter the authors' adherence to PLOS ONE policies on sharing data and materials, with one exception. The exact composition of the tablet formulation is proprietary, however the authors have disclosed the major excipients in the manuscript. The exact composition of the tablet is not necessary to replicate the results of this study, indeed, the study could be replicated with freshly prepared bacteria applied vaginally to the macaques with hydroxylethylcellulose as described in Lagenaur et al., 2011.","2015","04","Laurel A Lagenaur","LAL",4,TRUE,2,3,3,3,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,0,NA,FALSE
