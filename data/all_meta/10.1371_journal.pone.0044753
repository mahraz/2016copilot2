N.G. and D.H.B. are listed as co-inventors on pending U.S. patent applications, claiming diagnostic benefits from determining of ovarian FMR1 genotypes and sub-genotypes in association with female infertility. The patent claims are (1) Diagnostic relevance of CGG repeat numbers on the FMR1 gene in predicting functional ovarian reserve over time (i.e., ovarian aging patterns); (2) Newly described, so-called ‚Äúovarian‚Äù genotypes and sub-genotypes, based on a normal range of 26‚Ä34 CGG repeats as ‚Äúnormal‚Äù range; (3) Diagnostic relevance of these newly described genotypes and sub-genotypes in defining specific ovarian aging patterns and relevance to defining autoimmune risk. N.G. is the owner of The CHR, and A.K. and D.H.B. are employed there. A.W. is an associate visiting scientist at The CHR. The CHR was a funder of this study and where this research was conducted. The medical corporation, however, exerted no influence on this study. There are no further patents, products in development or marketed products to declare. This does not alter the authors‚Äô adherence to all the PLoS ONE policies on sharing data and materials, as detailed online in the guide for authors.","2012","09","Andrea Weghofer","AW",7,TRUE,3,2,4,1,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,0,NA,FALSE
