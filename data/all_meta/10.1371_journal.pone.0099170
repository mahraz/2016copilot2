Thus, there are no actual, intended or conceivable patents, products in development or products marketed to declare as being associated with the contents of this manuscript. The partial support from the Charoen Pokphand Company Ltd., Surathani Shrimp Farmers Club and public sectors listed above was offered simply to assist in investigations on the cause of shrimp mortality for the free benefit of the Thai and world shrimp industry and for the free, overall, benefit of the Thai and world economies.
