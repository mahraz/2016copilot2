The commercial product developed by DNAVEC Corporation is similar to the vectors described in this paper but the component is different. The patent of the Sendai virus vectors to generate iPS cells that was applied by and of DNAVEC Corporation is pending (WO/2010/008054). NF and HB have waived the right of the patent.
