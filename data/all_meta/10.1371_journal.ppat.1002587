Wrote the paper: JAS DWP.","I have read the Journal's policy and we have the following conflicts: MAJ holds shares in LigoCyte Pharmaceuticals, which together with Montana State University, held a National Institutes of Health contract that partially funded this work. LigoCyte Pharmaceuticals had no monetary or intellectual input toward the research nor the interpretation of this report. A provisional patent application of the therapeutic use of the Acai-derived polysaccharides has been submitted on behalf of JAS, JSH, IAS, MAJ, and DWP. Acai extract is contained in many commercial products. This does not alter the authors' adherence to all the journal policies on sharing data and materials. All other authors have no financial conflict of interest.","2012","03","Jerod A Skyberg","JAS",9,TRUE,3,4,3,2,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,0,NA,FALSE
