This patent covers the discovery of the KRAS-variant and testing the KRAS-variant that is discussed in this application. This marker has been licensed to a company that she has co-founded. Dr. Weidhaas is not employed by this company, but is a consultant. The company has developed the KRAS-variant as a test. The Irish cohort was supported partially from a commercial source, the Galway Biobank. These things do not alter the authors’ adherence to all the PLoS ONE policies on sharing data and materials. The rest of the authors have no conflicts.","2012","05","Robert Pilarski","RP",15,TRUE,4,6,2,15,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,0,NA,FALSE
