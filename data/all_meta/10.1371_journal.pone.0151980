To manage this conflict of interest DA has irrevocably capped the money that he can personally receive attributable to the Xpert assay to $5000 per year. DA also reports receiving research contracts from Cepheid. Martin Jones and Oliver Nanassy are employed by Cepheid. Cepheid supplied the study with Xpert MTB/RIF assay cartridges. Xpert MTB/RIF assay cartridges and GeneXpert instruments are marketed worldwide. Other than these, there are no patents, products in development or marketed products to declare used in this study.
