However, the submitted paper is on work that is independent of this grant. JSN-V-T has received funding to attend influenza related meetings, lecture and consultancy fees and research funding from several influenza antiviral drug and vaccine manufacturers. All forms of personal remuneration ceased in September 2010, but research funding from GlaxoSmithKline, Astra-Zeneca and F. Hoffmann-La Roche is ongoing. He is a former employee of SmithKline Beecham plc. (now GlaxoSmithKline), Roche Products Ltd (UK) and Aventis-Pasteur MSD (now Sanofi-Pasteur MSD), all prior to 2005, with no remaining pecuniary interests by way of share holdings, share options and pension rights. WSL has received unrestricted research funding from Pfizer for an unrelated study of pneumococcal pneumonia. KGN, SJB, JEE, JMcM, PJMO, RCR, BLT, BB and MGS have declared that no competing interests exist. None of the research funding for this particular study was from the several manufacturers mentioned nor from GlaxoSmithKline, Astra-Zeneca and F. Hoffmann-La Roche.
