Additionally two co-authors hold scientific posts in the Advanced Bionics European Research Centre. The study protocol was developed in close cooperation between MHH and Advanced Bionics. All testing was conducted at MHH by MHH employees and all data were again analyzed in close cooperation between Advanced Bionics and MHH.
