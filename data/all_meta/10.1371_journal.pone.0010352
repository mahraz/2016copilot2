Provided several antibodies and helpful discussion: CH.","Novartis Pharma AG employed one of the authors of this study (Christoph Heusser, PhD) and provided several monoclonal antibodies (anti-CD25 mAb, anti-IL2). However there are no patents/products in development/marketed productions in relation to this research. Indeed, another company provides these antibodies. Thus this does not alter adherence to all the PLoS ONE policies on sharing data and materials, as detailed in the guide for authors.","2010","04","Yannick D Muller","YDM",15,TRUE,5,9,8,6,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,0,NA,FALSE
