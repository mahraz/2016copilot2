Fluidigm Corp. owns patents covering the described microfludic technology including U.S Patent nos. 7,704,735, 7,704,735, 8,105,553, and 8,105,824 and other issued and pending U.S. and international patents. Co-authors Benjamin Michael Gerry, Marc Alexander Unger and Robert C. Jones are employed by Fluidigm Corp. Co-author Huan Phan was employed by Fluidigm during the course of the study and is now employed by NVS Technologies, Inc. There are no further patents, products in development or marketed products to declare. This does not alter our adherence to all the PLoS ONE policies on sharing data and materials.","2013","07","Swee Jin Tan","SJT",11,TRUE,8,6,3,3,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,0,NA,FALSE
