The following authors are employed by the U.S. Navy: David Moretti, Angela D'Amico, Nancy DiMarzio, Susan Jarvis, Elena McCarthy, Ronald Morrissey, and Jessica Ward. Their primary involvement was in designing, installing, and helping to operate the passive acoustic marine mammal monitoring system at the AUTEC range; providing the sound sources used in the experiments; and with analyzing and writing up the data. During the time period covered by this research the following authors were employed by the National Marine Fisheries Service of the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which acts as the federal regulatory agency for protection of marine mammals: Brandon Southall and John Durban. The following authors have been asked by the U.S. Department of Justice to act as expert witnesses in cases involving the effects of naval sonar on marine mammals: Christopher Clark, Brandon Southall, and Peter Tyack. Peter Tyack is a member of Natural Resources Defense Council, which is an advocacy organization that has sued the Navy concerning effects of sonar on marine mammals. None of the analysis nor write up of the paper involved or was influenced by the sponsors of the research.","2011","03","Peter L Tyack","PLT",14,TRUE,8,14,14,6,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,0,NA,FALSE
