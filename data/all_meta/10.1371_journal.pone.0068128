The patent has the following numbers: CA 2581347 (Canada Patent), 2006/040448 (PCT Patent), EP1797201 (EPO Patent), 20090081646 and 20110143354 (both United States Patent Application). These patents, titled “Universal primers and their use for detecting and identifying plant materials in complex mixtures”, only restrict commercial applications and have no impact on the use of this locus by academic researchers. Hence, the patents do not alter the authors’ adherence to the PLOS ONE policies on sharing data and materials.","2013","06","Eeva M Soininen","EMS",6,TRUE,6,4,2,5,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,0,NA,FALSE
