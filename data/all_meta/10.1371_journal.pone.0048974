Performed the experiments: MT AE HH. Analyzed the data: MT AE HH. Contributed reagents/materials/analysis tools: HH TF. Wrote the paper: HH MT.","Dr. Fukushima is a researcher who works at Yokohama Research Lab of Mitsubishi Rayon Company, and he and Dr. Hohjoh have collaborated on the development of a new type of DNA chip for detection of miRNAs. The authors have already published a few papers on the DNA chip, which was also used in this study. The collaboration has no financial bias, i.e., the company has never given excessive financial support to the collaboration. In addition, there is no issue conflicting with the financial competing interests between the company and the first and second authors and the corresponding author, i.e., the authors are not stock holders of the company, and have not received any grants and scholarship from the company. Therefore, the authors have never received any types of external pressure from the company in all the process of this study. Drs. Hohjoh and Fukushima have a pending patent regarding the DNA chip used in the current study. This does not alter the authors adherence to all the PLOS ONE policies on sharing data and materials.","2012","11","Masaki Takahashi","MT",4,TRUE,2,3,3,2,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,0,NA,FALSE
