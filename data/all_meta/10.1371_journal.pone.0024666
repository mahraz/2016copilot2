Designed and built the tracking module: GR.","The authors have read the journals policy and have the following conflicts: Gary Rondeau is employed by Applied Scientific Instrumentation (Eugene, OR) which builds a commercial version of the tracking system. This does not alter the authors adherence to all the PLoS ONE policies on sharing data and materials. Matthew Sottile is employed by Galois Inc. (Portland, OR) which has no financial or intellectual-property interests in the tracking system or in the software that supports it. Dr. Sottiles efforts on the project were and are entirely external to Galois Inc. Thus, his relationship to this company does not alter the authors adherence to all the PLoS ONE policies on sharing data and materials. The other authors have declared that no competing interests exist.","2011","09","Serge Faumont","SF",11,FALSE,4,3,4,3,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,0,NA,FALSE
