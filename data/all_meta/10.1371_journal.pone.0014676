It is a long term aim of the company to design drugs against cachexia. The current project is sponsored by a grant of the EU Network of excellence Rubicon to DDF and is aimed at understanding the molecular principles of growth hormone receptor degradation. The project was carried out in UMC Utrecht. AGSHvR was non-commercially involved in this study. This does not alter the authors adherence to all the PLoS ONE policies on sharing data and materials.
