WDG, SEH, JLC, and ST performed the experiments. WDG and YX analyzed the data. WDG contributed reagents/materials/analysis tools and wrote the paper. RSH was principal investigator and as such supervised experiments and paper writing. WDG did all paper and figure preparation, antibody generation, fixed imaging, and analysis. SEH, JLC, and ST performed live imaging of prometaphase. YX was first to identify filaments in polo-GFP.","The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.","2007","07","William D Gilliland","WDG",6,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
