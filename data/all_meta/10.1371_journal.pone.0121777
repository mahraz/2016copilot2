However, that has now expired and the authors removed this statement. In February 2011, Heng Huang and Arnd Pralle had filed a Provisional US Patent Application 61/444,404 \"Imaging FCS to determine membrane protein lipid domains association in vivo.\" A Provisional Patent Application expires after one year, and the formal final Application, due in Feb. 2012, was never filed correctly.
