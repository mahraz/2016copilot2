RVD is also an author of Tissue ablation with irreversible electroporation, US 8,048,067 B2 and PCT/US2004/043477. The patents outline various aspects of using IRE to treat tumors and in tissue engineering, but make no specific mention of the immune system in relation to the topics discussed in this report. In addition, REN and RVD received research funding for projects unrelated to the one presented here from Angiodynamics, Inc. RVD has previously served an advisory role for Angiodynamics, Inc. There are no further patents, products in development or marketed products to declare. This does not alter the authors' adherence to all the PLOS ONE policies on sharing data and materials.","2013","05","Robert E Neal","REN",8,TRUE,7,4,4,7,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,0,NA,FALSE
