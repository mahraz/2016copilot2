All these patents are owned by The University of Pennsylvania and all licensed exclusively to Cellscript. The inventors have no affiliation with Cellscript. Katalin Karikó and Drew Weissman are inventors of the following patents: Title: RNA Containing modified nucleosides and methods of use thereof. Inventors: Karikó K, Weissman D. Patents owned by University of Pennsylvania: U.S. Patent No. 8,278,036, 2012; U.S. Patent No. 8,691,966, 2014; U.S. Patent No. 8,748,089, 2014; and U.S. Patent No. 8,835,108, 2014. Katalin Karikó and Drew Weissman have also formed a small biotech company, RNARx, that received funding from the National Institutes of Health (R42HL87688) to explore the use of nucleoside-modified mRNA for transient gene therapy. Katalin Karikó and Hiromi Muramatsu are currently employed by Biontech RNA Pharmaceuticals GmbH, Mainz, Germany, where they develop mRNAs for clinical applications. They do not develop photolyase mRNA for any application. These authors moved to Biontech RNA Pharmaceuticals GmbH, Mainz, Germany after they performed their major role in the study at the U. Pennsylvania. Their contribution subsequently was to help to write the manuscript. They performed this task during their spare time off from work. There are no further patents, patent applications, products in development or marketed products to declare. This does not alter the authors adherence to all the PLOS ONE policies on sharing data and materials.","2015","06","Gábor Boros","GB",11,TRUE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
