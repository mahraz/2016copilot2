This patent does not cover the use of Pgp3 antibody to detect chlamydia antibody as a marker of previous infection as used in this study. PH has undertaken work for Cepheid investigating the utility and cost effectiveness of a point of care test for chlamydia and gonorrhoea. He has presented on this at a meeting sponsored by Cepheid. KS, SV, GW, SW, RP, AN, and ES have no conflict of interests that may be relevant to the submitted work. This does not alter the authorsâ€™ adherence to all the PLOS ONE policies on sharing data and materials.","2013","08","Paddy Horner","PH",9,TRUE,5,3,3,9,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,0,NA,FALSE
