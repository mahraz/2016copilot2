The Pharmanex Beijing Clinical Pharmacology Center was one of the Nu Skin Research Labs and was closed in Dec. 2013. The co-authors [YZD, LJZ, ZMW, LG, YSY, NZT] were staff scientists of Nu Skin Research Labs prior to its closure. Co-author JSZ was an employee of Nu Skin USA and left the company on Oct. 1, 2013 (currently an Adjunct Professor at Hong Kong Polytechnic Univ.). Co-authors LJZ and ZMW are currently employed by other institutes, and their jobs are completely unrelated to C. sinensis research. The remaining co-authors [YZD, LG, YSY, NZT] are currently unemployed, and JSZ remains in an adjunct position at the university. The majority of the work related to this paper was performed before the lab closure. The authors continued working on the project (e.g., data analyses, manuscript writing/revising, submitting/resubmitting) without salary support from Nu Skin after leaving the company in Oct. or Dec. 2013. This does not alter the authors adherence to PLoS ONE policies on sharing data and materials.","2014","10","Yun-Zi Dong","YZD",9,TRUE,2,2,5,2,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,0,NA,FALSE
