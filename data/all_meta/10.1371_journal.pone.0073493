It has been licensed to the FLARETM Foundation, a non-profit organization focused on promoting the dissemination of medical imaging technology for research and clinical use. Dr. Frangioni is the founder and chairman of the FLARETM Foundation. The Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center will receive royalties for sale of FLARETM Technology. Dr. Frangioni has elected to surrender post-market royalties to which he would otherwise be entitled as inventor, and has elected to donate pre-market proceeds to the FLARETM Foundation. Dr. Frangioni has started three for-profit companies, Curadel, Curadel ResVet Imaging, and Curadel Surgical Innovations, which may someday be non-exclusive sub-licensees of FLARETM technology. Co-authors Tiberiu M. Siclovan, Maria Zavodszky and Cristina A. Tan Hehir are employed by General Electric Company. Drs. Siclovan and Tan Hehir are inventors of patents and patent applications on technologies related to nerve imaging. These include US8169696B2 (Systems for intraoperative nerve imaging); US8114382B2 (Myelin detection using benzofuran derivatives); US20110142759A1 (Agents and methods for the imaging of myelin basic protein); US20100310457A1 and US20100310456A1 (imaging of myelin basic protein). There are no further products in development or marketed products to declare. This does not alter the authors adherence to all the PLOS ONE policies on sharing data and materials.","2013","09","Summer L Gibbs","SLG",10,TRUE,4,7,8,1,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,0,NA,FALSE
