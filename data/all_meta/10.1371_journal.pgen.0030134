PK performed all the yeast-related experiments except for the examination of Rad53 activity, which was done with the help of FDS. MG examined the formation of 53BP1 foci in response to 4-DP and examined the activation of the checkpoint response by Western blotting. JB quantitated γ-H2AX formation by flow cytometry. RKS mapped the breakpoints by CGH. SN examined the levels of apoptosis in response to 4-DP. SG performed some of the GCR assays. DCC determined uracil content in genomic DNA. PK and DD wrote the paper with valued input from RKS, DCC, and PLO.","The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.","2007","08","Pamela Kanellis","PK",10,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
