However, NIH held the IND for the tenofovir gel in this study, not CONRAD, not Gilead. CONRAD did not provide financial support. Gilead had no role in this study - neither the design, drug supply, data collection and analysis, decision to publish, or preparation of the manuscript. MTN paid for the tenofovir gel. Finally, there are no restrictions to data from MTN-001 which is controlled by CONRAD or Gilead Sciences. This does not alter the authors’ adherence to all the PLOS ONE policies on sharing data and materials.","2013","01","Craig W Hendrix","CWH",14,TRUE,10,14,6,14,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,0,NA,FALSE
