Initially, one of the objectives of the clinical trial was to investigate the effects of Sitagliptin therapy on glycosylated haemoglobin from baseline to 18 weeks in young (18-40 years), non-obese, Asian Indians with type 2 diabetes. However, in the revised version of the trial, this objective was not carried out. The funder had no direct or indirect role in study design, conducting the study, data management, statistical analysis, manuscript preparation or decision to publish. Further, it had no association for consultancy, employment, patent or product development and marketed products. The corresponding author (AM) was the Principal investigator for one of the many study sites in India, for a multisite, randomized, placebo controlled clinical trial: Trial Investigating Cardiovascular Outcomes with Sitagliptin (TECOS, Funded and conducted by Merck) in patients with Type 2 diabetes and inadequate glycemic control. Further, National Diabetes, Obesity and Cholesterol foundation (N DOC) New Delhi, India, supported employment, staff salaries and costs for laboratory investigations in the study. However, this does not alter the authors' adherence to PLOS ONE policies on sharing data and materials.","2015","10","Anoop Misra","AM",6,TRUE,1,1,2,6,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,0,NA,FALSE
