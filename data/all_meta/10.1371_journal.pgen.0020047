Kai, J. Kawai, P. Carninci, and Y. Hayashizaki contributed sequence data and managed the collaborative project together with C. Wahlestedt. P. G. Engström, B. Lenhard, and L. Lipovich compiled the dataset of TUs, pairs, and chains, performed all analyses not specifically mentioned below, and coordinated the work together with C. Wells. P. G. Engström, H. Suzuki, B. Lenhard, and L. Lipovich designed the PCR experiments together with N. Ninomiya, who performed them. L. Lipovich contributed the analyses of positional equivalents and chain conservation with assistance from P. G. Engström, G. Kunarso, and E. L.-C. Ng. The TSS distribution and sequence composition of bidirectional promoters were analyzed by P. G. Engström, A. Akalin, and B. Lenhard. P. G. Engström, L. Luzi, S. Batalov, C. Wells, J. F. Reid, and B. Lenhard performed the microarray data analysis. L. Sessa, G. Lavorgna, and V. Orlando contributed the analysis of homeotic loci. A. Brozzi, S. L. Tan, L. Yang, and V. B. Bajic contributed additional analyses that had to be excluded because of space constraints. P. G. Engström, L. Lipovich, and B. Lenhard designed and wrote the paper, with contributions from H. Suzuki, L. Luzi, V. B. Bajic, V. Orlando, and J. F. Reid.","The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.","2006","04","Pär G Engström","PGE",24,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
