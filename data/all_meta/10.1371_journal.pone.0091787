Performed the experiments: JH HS RW SC. Analyzed the data: JH HS RW SC. Contributed reagents/materials/analysis tools: HS RW. Wrote the paper: JH HS SC.","Among all the authors, Sufan Chien is the only person who has patented the intracellular ATP delivery technique and is considered to have a financial conflict of interest. Here are the two US patents in which they are involved: 1. Ehringer, W.D. and Chien, S.: Direct cellular energy delivery system (US patent number: 7,056,529); 2. Ehringer, W.D. and Chien, S.: Wound healing compositions and methods of use (US patent number: 7,041,312). However, all the authors' experiments were performed under strict scientific guidance and the article is written based on critical data. Thus, the above patent ownership does not alter the authors' adherence to all the PLOS ONE policies on sharing data and materials.","2014","03","Jeffrey D Howard","JDH",4,TRUE,4,4,4,3,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,0,NA,FALSE
