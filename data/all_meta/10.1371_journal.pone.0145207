Performed the experiments: FRA VG AS R. Anagonou NA. Analyzed the data: FRA FO. Contributed reagents/materials/analysis tools: MCA. Wrote the paper: FRA. FRA R. Azondekon MS MCA.","All relationships between Tagros and CREC or Tagros and a researcher of CREC are professional. Tagros finances the studies that the authors submit to her if these studies are found relevant. The recorded data are analyzed by the CREC and the results are discussed without the intervention of Tagros. Besides the scientific work funded by Tagros, CREC has never received other favours from Tagros. So, the authors' relationship with Tagros does not alter their adherence to PLOS ONE policies on sharing data and materials.","2015","12","Fiacre R Agossa","FRA",9,TRUE,3,4,2,1,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,2,"5;8",TRUE
