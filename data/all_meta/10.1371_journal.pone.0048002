Dr. Moreno has received research support from Cyberonics. There are no patents or products in development to declare. Cyberonics manufactures and markets the VNS Therapy System for the treatment-resistant depression and drug-resistant epilepsy indications. However, this does not alter the authors adherence to all the PLOS ONE policies on sharing data and materials. results will be posted at clinicaltrials.gov as required by law. The study results will be published by law, so the decision to publish is not made solely by Cyberonics. Cyberonics was required by the US Food, Drug and Cosmetic Law to post this study on clinicaltrials.gov, a US registry of clinical studies. Posting the study creates a legal obligation for Cyberonics to post study results in a timely manner on clinicaltrials.gov so, at a minimum, results will be posted at that clinical trial registry upon study completion.","2012","10","Bryan Olin","BO",4,TRUE,NA,1,2,4,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,0,NA,FALSE
