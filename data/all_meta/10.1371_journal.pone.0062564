This does not alter the authors adherence to all the PLOS ONE policies on sharing data and materials. LYR and KZRare employees of ChromoTek. KZR is also a shareholder of the company. Furthermore, ChromoTek has applied for a patent for the basic principle of the F2H Assay but this is of course currently still pending. All data generated in the course of this collaborative project will be made freely available. The cellular characterization of the mutants was conducted free of charge at ChromoTek and the respective sequences were obtained from the p53lab. In case somebody is interested in performing the same assay, Chromotek will guarantee a cost-free collaborative service for academic, non-profit researchers. Chromotek sees the described p53- Mdm2 F2H Assay as a proof-of-principle study and is not aiming at marketing or making profit with it. However, this cost-free service for non-profit organizations does not apply for any other protein-protein interaction assayed in F2H. In principle the commercial product F2H assay is the assay development which Chromotek does for custom specific PPIs. Subsequently Chromotek does either perform a screen in house or transfers the technology to the customer. Chromotek confirms the PLOS ONE policy and declares the following: This does not alter the authors adherence to all the PLOS ONE policies on sharing data and materials.","2013","04","Siau Jia Wei","SJW",8,TRUE,3,6,8,1,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,0,NA,FALSE
