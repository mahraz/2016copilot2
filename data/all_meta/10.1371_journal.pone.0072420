Additionally, Anna McConville is employed as an ecological consultant and has worked for a company which was contracted to work for Wambo Coal. Anna McConville also had a personal relationship (friend) with the environmental officer at Wambo Coal when the funding was issued. The funding was used to assist with field expenses. There were no conditions attached to the funding, the company did not influence the design or direction of research and no comments were provided on written material. The project does not directly relate to the operations of Wambo Coal Pty Ltd and the authors do not stand to gain (future commissions or funding) from the publication of this manuscript. Additionally, this does not alter the authors' adherence to all the PLOS ONE policies on sharing data and materials.","2013","08","Anna McConville","AMC",3,TRUE,3,1,1,3,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,0,NA,FALSE
