Dr. Masaru Mimura (Showa University, from 2004 to 2011 and Keio University, since 2011) is the principal investigator of this study. Dr. Shingo Kawasaki is an employee of Hitachi Medical Corporation. From 2004 to 2011, Showa University had an official contract with Hitachi Medical Corporation for a collaborative study on the clinical application of Near Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS). For this study, Hitachi Medical Corporation provided an equipment support (temporary rental of a NIRS system, ETG 4000) from 2004 to 2009. From 2011 to 2013, Keio University had an official contract with Hitachi Medical Corporation for a collaborative study on the clinical application of NIRS.
