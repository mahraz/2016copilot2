Wrote the paper: TH RP TS RE CM KG.","The University Hospital Gießen and Marburg GmbH (UKGM) is a private hospital run by a shareholding company. Michael Hertl (MH) has a dual appointment as head of the clinical department (run by UKGM) and as professor and chairman (employed by the state of Hesse). UGKM has agreed by contract with the state of Hesse to provide funds for research grants (1 million Euro per year) which are given by the medical faculty of Marburg (run by the state of Hesse) on a peer review selection process. Thus, the grant that MH received was non-commercial and given by the medical faculty of the University of Marburg. There was no conflict of interest or commercial bias involved in receiving the grant. This does not alter the authors adherence to PLOS ONE policies on sharing data and materials.","2016","02","Tina Hennerici","TH",9,TRUE,6,2,5,6,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,0,NA,FALSE
