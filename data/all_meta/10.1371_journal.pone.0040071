(employing authors TAM and BJB respectively) do not have any financial or professional interests that would jeopardize the full and objective presentation of data and ideas in this paper. The authors TAM and BJB are under contract to assist with the production of primary research that fulfills the mandate of the Ambient Monitoring Program, a collaborative agreement between Metro Vancouver (formerly the Greater Vancouver Regional District) and the Department of Fisheries and Oceans (Government of Canada). This project requires the objective and full peer-reviewed publication of research on which to base future long-term monitoring, and examinations of anthropogenic impacts and climate change in the Strait of Georgia, British Columbia, Canada. Both funding parties have committed to the free publication of this research. The publication of this manuscript would not result in any financial gain or loss to the authors or any affiliated organization.
