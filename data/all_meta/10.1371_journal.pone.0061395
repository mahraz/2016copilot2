Employees of GSK Biologicals reviewed and commented on early draft manuscripts, but were not involved in the final approval of the manuscript. GSK Biologicals did not fund the investigators to undertake the analysis. GSK funded transport expenses for the investigators to attend a meeting to discuss their progress.
