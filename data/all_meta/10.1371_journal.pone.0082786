Wrote the paper: AvtH FC AV SvK SD DA JE.","The authors AvH, AV, SvK, SD and JE have declared that no competing interests exist. The authors have read the journals policy and declare possible conflicts for the authors DA and FC: DA receives royalties from licensing fees from the UMDNJ molecular beacon patent pool. Cepheid, which manufactures the Xpert test pays UMDNJ licensing fees for the molecular beacons used in the test. This conflict has been managed as follows: DA has irrevocably limited the amount of money that he can personally receive from Cepheid license payments to $4,999 per year. DA served as an ad-hoc unpaid member of the Cepheid advisory board in 2010. Cepheid did not pay for any expenses, including no payment for travel, meals, honorarium etc to DA or his laboratory. DAs laboratory received a $20,000 research grant from Cepheid in 2010 to perform a blinded study of clinical samples using the Xpert assay. DA no longer accepts research grants from Cepheid. FC serves as a consultant for the Foundation of Innovative New Diagnostics (FIND) and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. This does not alter the authors adherence to all the PLOS ONE policies on sharing data and materials.","2013","12","Anna H van’t Hoog","AHVH",7,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
