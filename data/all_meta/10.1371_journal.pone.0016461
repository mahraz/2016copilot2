However, the company played no other role in this study. The collaboration was based on Berry Spruijts expertise in behavioural phenotyping and not on anything related to the company. Moreover, the costs for the study (animals, consumables) and the costs for the biotechnician who tested the animals was covered by the grant provided by the German Research Foundation (DFG). The authors confirm that the affiliation to this company does not alter their adherence to all the PLoS ONE policies on sharing data and materials.","2011","01","S Helene Richter","SHR",16,TRUE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
