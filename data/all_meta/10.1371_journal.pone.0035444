Wrote the paper: BL KS BN LL MF SR.","The authors have read the journals policy and have the following potential conflict: The empirical analysis in this paper is based on the use of the PIMA Analyzer technology, which is available in South Africa through a company called Alere. Through interactions with the United States Agency for International Development in South Africa, Alere provided 4 Pima Analyzer units to the mobile program (called Access VCT) to use during their pilot program. Alere had no input into the manuscript the authors are submitting. Since Alere did provide the technologies to the mobile VCT program, and the authors used information on costs from the mobile program, the authors wanted to mention the situation here. This does not alter the authors adherence to all the PLoS ONE policies on sharing data and materials.","2012","04","Bruce Larson","BL",6,TRUE,NA,NA,6,6,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,0,NA,FALSE
