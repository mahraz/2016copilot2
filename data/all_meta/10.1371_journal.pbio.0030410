RP and JF jointly prepared the tables, wrote the paper, and prepared Text S1. JF conceived the computation of shortest-path distances, summarized the computation in Text S2, prepared Text S3 and Figure 2, and computed the observed and predicted speed ranges. AJA made suggestions on the interpretation of the results, on the shortest-path distance computations, on the calibration of dates, and on the write-up of the paper.","The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.","2005","11","Ron Pinhasi","RP",3,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
