The device has been sold, to date, to various research laboratories. Their company, Thornhill Research Inc. (TRI) and the University of Toronto, stand to benefit financially if their MPET device is sold as a consequence of the report here. Drs. Mutch, Ellis and Ryner have submitted a patent protecting some of the methodology described here to assess concussion. If the technology developed is commercialized, these individuals, TRI and the University of Manitoba could benefit financially.
