Quidel provided the study with some of the YKL-40 ELISA kits. The study sponsors had no role in the design and conduct of the study; in the collection, management, analysis, and interpretation of the data; or in the preparation, review, or approval of the manuscript. The authors had full access to all the data in the study and had the final responsibility for the decision to submit the manuscript for publication. There is no patent for plasma YKL-40 or IL-6 analysis for pancreatic cancer. Julia S. Johansen and Paul Price developed the monoclonal and the polyclonal antibodies used in the ELISA from Quidel. University of California, San Diego, USA has a patent regarding YKL-40 as a biomarker and receive royalties from Quidel. Julia S. Johansen does not receive royalties from UCSD, since she has donated all royalties to the “YKL-40 Foundation” which donate travel grants to patients with cancer. For many years Julia S. Johansen received each year some YKL-40 kits from Quidel without cost, but she also bought some of the kits from Quidel. There is no contract between Julia S. Johansen and Quiedel.","2013","06","Nicolai A Schultz","NAS",16,TRUE,2,4,3,3,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,0,NA,FALSE
