GEM is a former post-doctoral researcher in our department. VT has generously supplied (upon our request) the amoebae species that were used in this work as well as the procedures for their propagation. However there are no potential competing interests and our affiliation with these co-authors at STERIS does not alter our adherence to all PLoS NTDs policies on sharing data and materials. STERIS has no competing interests in this work and simply provided us with necessary material to carry out this work. Again, our affiliation with STERIS does not in any way alter our compliance to any of PLoS NTDs data sharing policies.","2014","12","William H Wheat","WHW",10,FALSE,6,6,6,5,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,0,NA,FALSE
