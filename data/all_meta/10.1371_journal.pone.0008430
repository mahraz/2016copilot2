This does not alter our adherence to all the PLoS ONE policies on sharing data and materials. New England Biolabs (NEB), Inc. is the commercial supplier of PspGI restriction endonuclease and Taq DNA polymerase. In addition, NEB provided extensive and non-routine technical supports. SYX is employed at NEB. Thus, although NEB did not provide direct financial support, it can be considered as an indirect funder for this study.","2010","01","Xiaolong Wang","XW",3,TRUE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
