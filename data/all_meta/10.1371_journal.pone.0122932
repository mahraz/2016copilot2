The other authors have declared no competing interests exist. Note that Yale University has entered into a license agreement with Bessor Pharma to develop renalase as a potential diagnostic and therapeutic agent. This agreement does not preclude the publication of findings by my laboratory, and has no impact on the current manuscript. GVD confirms that these competing interests do not alter the authors adherence to all PLOS ONE policies on sharing data and materials, as detailed online in the guide for authors.","2015","04","Ling Wang","LW",5,FALSE,4,2,4,5,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,0,NA,FALSE
