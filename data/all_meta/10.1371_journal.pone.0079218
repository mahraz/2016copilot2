This manuscript simply describes a chemical quantitation method that was created and does not involve advocating any kind of commercial product. It was simply a more convenient method for testing that the authors felt could be useful to other investigators. Therefore, there is no financial stake for J& J or either of the authors involving this method, and the authors believe publishing this manuscript should not constitute any type of conflict of interest. This does not alter the authors adherence to all the PLOS ONE policies on sharing data and materials.","2013","11","Karson S Putt","KSP",2,TRUE,2,2,2,2,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,0,NA,FALSE
