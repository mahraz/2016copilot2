He is the original developer of the growth hormone transgenic Atlantic salmon, which was the result of research done at Memorial University. The lead author and all other co-authors do not have competing interests related to the research in this manuscript. This does not alter the authors adherence to all the PLOS ONE policies on sharing data and materials.","2014","04","Darek T R Moreau","DTRM",4,TRUE,3,1,1,4,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,0,NA,FALSE
