Performed the experiments: CG DL SA. Analyzed the data: CG FSM FRF. Wrote the paper: FSM FRF. Senior advisor: GB.","This work was funded through a grant from Pfizer Inc. and Pfizer Inc. supplied the compound, TP-10, used in these studies. This work was initiated while Dr. Menniti was an employee of the company; however, Dr. Menniti is no longer with Pfizer. The purpose of the grant was to fund the basic research presented in the manuscript with the full acknowledgment that the results would be published. In this way, all of the organizations interested in developing new therapies for Huntingtons disease would have access to the published results. It is the hope of the authors that the work encourages further research into the potential therapeutic benefit of PDE10A inhibition in the treatment of Huntingtons disease, regardless of whether such further research is for profit or not for profit. This does not alter the authors adherence to all the PLoS ONE policies on sharing data and materials.","2010","10","Carmela Giamp√†","CG√",6,TRUE,2,3,3,2,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,0,NA,FALSE
