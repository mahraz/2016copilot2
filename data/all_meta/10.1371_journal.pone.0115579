The submitted patent does not alter the authors’ adherence to all PLOS ONE policies on sharing data and materials, as detailed in http://www.PLOSone.org/static/editorial.action#competing. In addition, the authors would like to underline that the results reported in the present manuscript are original and not submitted elsewhere, including this pending patent. The content of the submitted patent is dedicated mostly to the effects of BDNF in a rodent model of photoreceptors’ degeneration. The part dedicated to experimental glaucoma deals with different BDNF concentrations and ages of treatment and, therefore, there are no overlapping results with the present manuscript and, as a consequence, no restrictions.","2014","12","Luciano Domenici","LD",8,TRUE,2,4,1,NA,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,0,NA,FALSE
