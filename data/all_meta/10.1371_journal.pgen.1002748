Initially conceived the project: JF AF C-MC. Obtained samples from the crosses: AF JF. Performed the developmental biology study: PW. Performed SNP analyses to locate the genomic region of F gene: PW HZ RBW M-LM SML PIP C-MC. Sequenced the region and identified the deletion in KRT75: CSN C-FC C-JH Y-TL W-SL W-HL. Tested the mutated gene: PW CSN. Tested the biophysical property of the feather: W-TJ PW CSN C-MC. Put the data together: CSN PW JF AF W-TJ PIP W-HL C-MC.","The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.","2012","07","Chen Siang Ng","CSN",16,FALSE,3,1,NA,8,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,1,"5",FALSE
