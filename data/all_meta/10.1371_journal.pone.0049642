Medtronic scientists (co-authors Susan Rea Peterson and Shola S. Sulaimon) initiated the contract and performed particular experiments described in the manuscript, including RT-PCR and HPLC, and assisted in data interpretation and the description of their activities in the final manuscript. Medtronic Inc. did not influence the decision to publish, the selection of the appropriate journal for mansucript submission, nor any decision related to data interpretation or data integrity. Drs. Dalman, Iida, Xu, Schultz, Chow, and Ms. White have no ownership of stocks or shares in Medtronic, or any company which manufactures medications used in this study, as well as no employment relationship, consultancy, board membership, patent applications (pending or actual), including individual applications or those belonging to the institution to which authors are affiliated and which the authors may benefit from. A research contract (which defined work to be performed without specifying expected outcomes or data analysis) was provided by Medtronic to support the cost of some of the experiments described in this manuscript. No Stanford authors have received travel grants or honoraria for speaking or participation at meetings or gift directly from Medtronic in regards to this research or any other activity. This does not alter the authors adherence to all the PLOS ONE policies on sharing data and materials.","2012","12","Yasunori Iida","YI",9,TRUE,5,7,6,3,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,0,NA,FALSE
