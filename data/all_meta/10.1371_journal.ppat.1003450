Some of the data in this publication have been used in the patent applications WO2010/032008 and WO2011/117582 which are owned by the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) in agreement with the University of Oxford, and were licenced to IXO Therapeutics Ltd. until 31st Dec 2012; the licence has now expired and there are currently no commercial activities relating to these patents. SGP, CK, PAN and JMA were formerly shareholders of, and SGP, GCP and JMA were consultants to, IXO Therapeutics Ltd.; this spin-out company is no longer operational.
