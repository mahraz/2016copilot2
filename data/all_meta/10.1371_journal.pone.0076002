The authors received an investigator--initiated grant from Merck, which supported some of this research (and is listed under financial nformation). The authors also previously held an investigator--initiated grant from Janssen Diagnostics on a different, unrelated research topic; Janssen support did not contribute to the research described in this submission. MDP requested and received free reagents (Viro--Adembeads) from the manufacturer (Ademtech, Pessac, France) that were used in this research. This does not alter the authors adherence to all the PLOS ONE policies on sharing data and materials.","2013","10","MariaPia De Pasquale","MPDP",4,TRUE,3,3,4,4,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,0,NA,FALSE
