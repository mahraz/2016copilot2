Dr. Rutkove is named as an inventor on two patent applications in the field of electrical impedance. Neither the first patent (entitled “electrical impedance myography”) or the second patent (entitled a “device for performing electrical impedacne myography”) are directly relevant to this publication, as both relate to the development of an automated device for human use. However, since both are in the field of electrical impedance, the author has disclosed them.
