The investigations reported in this manuscript were of scientific interest. The investigations could have been done by other institutions in a similar manner because the vaccine and drug used in the experiments are commercially available. The publication does not touch patents, consultancy or products in development. The vaccine administered is a marketed product of IDT Biologika GmbH. It was used because no other trivalent swine influenza vaccine containing H1N2 is licensed in Europe. This does not alter the authors' adherence to all PLOS ONE policies on sharing data and materials.","2013","04","Ralf Duerrwald","RD",6,TRUE,2,2,4,2,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,0,NA,FALSE
