Performed the experiments: NG DHB. Analyzed the data: IHL DHB. Contributed reagents/materials/analysis tools: NG AW DHB. Wrote the paper: NG.","The authors have read the journals policy and have the following conflicts: NG and DHB are listed as co-inventors on a number of pending United States patents and one already granted patent, which, peripherally, relate to this manuscript. Those patents claim: (1) Therapeutic benefits from supplementation of women with DOR with dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA). Since some patients in this study were DHEA supplemented, this may have relevance. (2) Diagnostic benefits from determining triple CGG nucleotide repeats on the FMR1 gene in attempts to assess and predict ovarian reserve. NG is owner of the Center for Human Reproduction (CHR), where this study was conducted. The authors confirm that these conflicts do not alter our adherence to all the PLoS ONE policies on sharing data and materials.","2010","12","Norbert Gleicher","NG",4,TRUE,4,2,2,1,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,0,NA,FALSE
