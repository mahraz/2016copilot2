Performed the experiments: AH. Analyzed the data: AH. Wrote the manuscript: AH SW SE FW. Designed, manufactured and validated the stamping device: SW.","One of the authors (Stefan Eick) is affiliated to Aesculap AG, which partly funded this study. Aesculap AG is a purveyor of surgical instuments, with an in-depth experience in wound healing. As a matter of pre-competitive basic research, Aesculap partly funded this study to broaden the understanding of wound healing after the application of electrosurgery, for which currently
there is little data available. Stefan Eick was providing insight into the application of state-of-the-art electrosurgical instruments as well as providing information about the temperatures to which tissues are exposed during electrosurgery, which was crucial for setting-up the model system, as it is meant to reflect these conditions as closely as possible. His co-authorship does not alter the authors adherence to all the PLOS ONE policies on sharing data and materials.","2013","12","Alice Hettler","AH",5,TRUE,3,1,1,4,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,0,NA,FALSE
