The company has been founded on the base of the former communal commercial enterprice, and before that, the laboratory has worked as the Laboratory of Tampere University Hospital. In Fimlab Laboratories, this research work has been funded by external, non-commercial Competitive Research Funding of Tampere University Hospital. None of the authors own stocks or shares of the Fimlab, no patent applications exist concerning the manuscript subject, and no economical benefits are obtained f.ex. from the PTX3 test kit firm (test kits are bought straight from the market).
