Prof. Anderson received consultancy fees from Servier and Alkermes, an honorarium for speaking from Lundbeck and grant support from Servier and AstraZeneca. Rebecca Elliott received consultancy fees from Cambridge Cognition and P1vital. This does not alter the authors' adherence to PLOS ONE policies on sharing data and materials. The other authors report no conflict of interest.","2015","03","Gabriella Juhasz","GJ",14,TRUE,5,8,7,6,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,0,NA,FALSE
