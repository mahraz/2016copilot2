However, usage of that plasmid was already described in the authors previous paper. And the authors already applied patents on the usage of the plasmid in the protein production (patent number PCT/JP2005/020972). After the paper may be published in Plos ONE, any reader may use the plasmid if she/he purchase the plasmid or she/he contract for the usage of the plasmid with the patent owner, Hiroshima University. Therefore, this does not alter the authors adherence to all the Plos ONE policies on sharing data and materials.","2012","07","Yoshio Araki","YA",4,TRUE,4,3,4,1,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,0,NA,FALSE
