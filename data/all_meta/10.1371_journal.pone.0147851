Turgut Durduran is an inventor on a relevant patent (Patent US8082015B2, “Optical measurement of tissue blood flow, hemodynamics and oxygenation”). ICFO has equity ownership in the spin-off company HemoPhotonics S.L. Udo Weigel is the CEO, has equity ownership in HemoPhotonics S.L. and is an employee in the company. Udo Weigel’s involvement in the study was mainly during his post-doctoral fellowship at ICFO where he has contributed to the construction of the device and the protocol elaboration. After his employment at HemoPhotonics, he has contributed to the editing of the paper but not to the decision on publication, data interpretation and analysis. Potential financial conflicts of interest and objectivity of research have been monitored by ICFO’s Knowledge & Technology Transfer Department.
