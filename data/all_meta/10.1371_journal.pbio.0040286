JAE, RSC, EPH, and EO wrote and edited the majority of the manuscript. JAE, RSC, MW, DW, JHB, and MT performed multiple bioinformatics analyses. MT, JRW, PA, MF, RKS, and BJH coordinated the annotation. KMJ and LJT carried out genome closure. ALD and SLS generated and analyzed genome assemblies. JCS, KMK, and LS analyzed mobile DNA elements. WHM generated gene models. QR conducted analyses of membrane transporters. JMC, JG, and REP generated and analyzed ESTs. GM analyzed protein kinases. NCE and APT analyzed membrane trafficking. DJA and DEW analyzed dyneins. YW and HC analyzed proteases. KC, BAS, SRL, WLR, KW, and ZW analyzed ncRNA. DW, JG, MAG, JF, and CCT analyzed cytoskeletal associated proteins. PJK, RFW, NJP, and JHB searched for plastid-derived genes. JMC, NAS, and CJK built TGD. CdT, HFR, SCW, and RAB performed the RAPD analyses. EPH, EO, SLS, JAE, and MW examined genome structure.","The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.","2006","08","Jonathan A Eisen","JAE",53,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
