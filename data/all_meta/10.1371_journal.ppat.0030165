RBJ designed, validated, and performed the quantitative PCR experiments with the assistance of NA. KEG, NA, DAM, and RBJ, JMC, and DFN performed the ELISPOT analysis of T cell responses. ALE performed the 51Cr-release assays. AA performed the initial database searches to identify peptide sequences, with KEG, AA, FMH, and DFN developing the selection process for the peptides. KEG and LCN performed the multicolor flow cytometry experiments. FMH directs the OPTIONS cohort, with GS as data manager, which provided samples for the study. SRN and JL were important early contributors to the initial selection of HERV insertions on which to focus further experimentation. MAO and DFN are equal last authors.","KEG, RBJ, DAM, AA, FMH, SRN, JL, MAO, and DFN are named as inventors on a patent application, based on this work, which was filed by their respective institutions.","2007","11","Keith E Garrison","KEG",14,TRUE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,FALSE
