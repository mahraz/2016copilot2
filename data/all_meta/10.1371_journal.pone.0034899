Rüdiger Alt received co-funding and cord blood samples from Vita 34 AG while working on this project at the Universität Leipzig and is now employed by Vita 34. Co-funding and common scientific standards and goals for this project were defined in a formal agreement between Vita 34 AG and the Universität Leipzig. Vita 34 AG is a private cord blood bank. However, as the results of this study demonstrates cord blood derived VSEL cells to be devoid of stem cell potential, there is no obvious application of VSEL cells, and hence, no conceivable financial conflict of interest. There are no patents, products in development, or marketed products to declare. This does not alter the authors adherence to all the PLoS ONE policies on sharing data and materials, as detailed online in the guide for authors.","2012","04","Ralitza Danova-Alt","RDA",5,TRUE,5,3,3,2,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,0,NA,FALSE
