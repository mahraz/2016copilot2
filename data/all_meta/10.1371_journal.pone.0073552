Pfizer organized this consortium to provide funding for basic research, initiated by academic scientists, which would have relevance to future improvements in dairy cattle fertility. There was no commercial or practical application that was necessary and although Pfizer provided the original funding, there was no expectation or requirement that they receive anything from the research. They have not evaluated or approved of the research that is contained in this manuscript and they have not evaluated or read this manuscript. Therefore, the authors clearly declare that this funding does not alter their adherence to all the PLOS ONE policies on sharing data and materials. In addition, one of the authors currently works in a commercial company (Procter and Gamble) besides still holding an affiliate faculty position at the Department of Pathobiological Sciences, School of Veterinary Medicine at University of Wisconsin-Madison. All aspects of the work were completed prior to him taking up the job at the commercial company. The authors also declare that this affiliation does not alter their adherence to all the PLOS ONE policies on sharing data and materials.","2013","09","Carla A Piccinato","CAP",5,TRUE,2,1,3,3,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,0,NA,FALSE
