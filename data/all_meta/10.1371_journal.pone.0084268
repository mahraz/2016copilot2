The patent application presented covers the new synthetic SAR elements, SAR1 and SAR2 and SARIK1β. As a result it covers all sequences, such as the IS2 insulator, that contained any of these sequences. All authors are affiliated to GENYO (Centre for Genomic and Oncological Research), a public center co-financed by Pfizer, the University of Granada and the Andalusian Regional Government. All authors are financed by the Andalusian Regional Government and do not have any contract with Pfizer.
