Performed the experiments: GJB JMS. Analyzed the data: AJS GJB DJM. Contributed reagents/materials/analysis tools: AJS JMS. Wrote the paper: AJS JMS DJM. Designed the decision tree: AJS JMS.","This study was partly funded by Diagnoptics Technologies. AJS is founder and shareholder, and JMS is also shareholder of Diagnoptics Technologies B.V., the Netherlands. Diagnoptics Technologies is the company that developed the AGE Reader, which is used in the present article. AJS was also the first inventor in the patent used for the AGE reader technology. He was inventor as employee of the University Medical Center Groningen (UMCG), which was co-owner of it. Later the patent was sold to Diagnoptics Technologies, so the UMCG has no financial interests anymore. AJS now works 80% of his time as as employee of the University Medical Center Groningen, but is also the scientific director of Diagnoptics technologies. As such, he has an interest in development and validation of possible further future applications of the AGE reader, such as described in the present paper. The other authors have declared that no competing interests exist; the personnel involved in the two participating hospitals in the study also had no competing interests. There are no further patents, products in development or marketed products to declare. This does not alter the authors adherence to all the PLOS ONE policies on sharing data and materials, as detailed online in the guide for authors.","2013","06","Andries J Smit","AJS",4,FALSE,2,2,3,3,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,0,NA,FALSE
