Christiansen (OBC), was investigator in three of the randomised clinical trials on the topic and another, Pia Egerup (PE), was investigator in one of the randomised clinical trials on the topic. To avoid potential bias, OBC did not participate in the selecting of relevant trials or in the data analyses and PE did not participate when the data of the trial that she co-authored were analysed. The remaining review team members controlled PEs work. The remaining review team members (JL and CG) declare that they have no competing interest.
