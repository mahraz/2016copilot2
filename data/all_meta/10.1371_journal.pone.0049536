Performed the experiments: KHL WFC EY. Analyzed the data: KHL WFC EY IE. Contributed reagents/materials/analysis tools: KHL WFC EY IE. Wrote the paper: IE. Conceived the original project to probe for polymorphisms in the dper 3′ UTR that might be affecting dmpi8 splicing and daily activity patterns: IE. Identified the different polymorphisms in the dper 3′ UTR, generated the VT1.1 and VT1.2 sub-lines, assayed their behavior and dmpi8 splicing phenotypes, with help from KHL: WFC. Generated and analyzed the S2 cell constructs used in this study: WFC. Generated and analyzed the transgenic flies bearing the different SNP3/4 hybrids: KHL. Contributed to the analysis of activity rhythms: EY .","The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.","2012","11","Kwang Huei Low","KHL",4,FALSE,4,3,4,1,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,0,NA,FALSE
