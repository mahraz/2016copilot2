Several of the authors are employees of Bio-Rad and own Bio-Rad stock through an employee stock purchase program; Bio-Rad sells droplet digital PCR systems that can be used to perform assays such as those in the paper. In addition, several authors are inventors on a patent application that includes claims related to measurement of linked DNA species in droplets. This does not alter the authors’ adherence to PLoS ONE policies on sharing data and materials.","2015","03","John F Regan","JFR",11,TRUE,1,1,3,2,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,2,"3;7",TRUE
