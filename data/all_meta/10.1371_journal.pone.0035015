Furthermore Anita Kloss-Brandstätter received funding from the Österreichische Nationalbank. Although this sounds like a commercial source, this is not a commercial source. It is kind of a state bank which started a fund at the time of their 150-year anniversary. This fund is supporting scientific projects which undergo a peer-review system. Decision about the funding is made by an independent panel of scientists. This does not alter the authors adherence to all the PLoS ONE policies on sharing data and materials.","2012","04","Anita Kloss-Brandstätter","AKB",16,TRUE,3,5,7,6,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,0,NA,FALSE
