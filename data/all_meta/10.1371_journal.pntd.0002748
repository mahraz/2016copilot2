The Viral Hemorrhagic Fever Consortium (vhfc.org) is a partnership of academic and industry scientists who are developing diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines for LF and other severe diseases. Tulane University and various industry partners have filed United States and foreign patent applications on behalf of the consortium for several of these technologies. If commercial products are developed, consortium members may receive royalties or profits. This does not alter our adherence to all PLOS policies on sharing data and materials.","2014","03","Jeffrey G Shaffer","JGS",52,TRUE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
