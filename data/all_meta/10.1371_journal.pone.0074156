Wrote the paper: GR KK CL DP MJ CE SK FE.","Dr. David Andrew Porter is an employee and shareholder of Siemens AG, and is the developer of the resolve pulse sequence. Given the fact that the used high-resolution DTI sequence is not available at our site (even though it is a commercial product) a cooperation with Dr. Porter was established for sequence support. There are two relevant patents in Dr. Porter’s name (Patent No.: US 7,205,763 B2; Apr. 17, 2007 and Patent No.: US 7,417,427 B2; Aug. 26, 2008). The first patent covers the combination of readout-segmented EPI and 2D navigator correction. The second patent concerns the use of 2D navigator data to control the data reacquisition process. The patents are owned by Siemens AG, but he has received financial compensation for submitting them. The diffusion-weighted, readout-segmented EPI technique is a commercial product on some Siemens MR systems and is marketed under the under the product name ‘syngo RESOLVE’. There are no further patents, products in development or marketed products to declare. This does not alter the authors’ adherence to all the PLOS ONE policies on sharing data and materials, as detailed online in the guide for authors.","2013","09","Gernot Reishofer","GR",8,TRUE,6,4,3,8,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,0,NA,FALSE
