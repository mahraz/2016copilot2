Brennan, Rinaldi, Goodyear and Willison are named inventors in a patent pending relating to materials and methods for detecting interactions between lipid complexes and lipid binding agents. A patent entitled Detection of interactions between lipid complexes and lipid binding agents  (PCT/GB2009/001665, pending application) covering aspects of the described array technology has been filed. The University of Glasgow does not seek to make a commercial return from this technology, which is available to companies under an Easy Access Licence.
