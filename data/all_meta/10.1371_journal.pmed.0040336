All authors contributed to writing the paper. AN developed (i.e., researched, programmed, tested, and implemented) the stochastic simulator of cholera in Matlab (Bangladesh), and analyzed and interpreted the statistical and epidemiological results generated by the simulator. MY was involved as an investigator in the cholera vaccine trial that was conducted in the Matlab field area of the ICDDR,B from 1985 to 1989. NS helped analyze the simulation studies and transformed results into figures. Analysis of the data was based on a trial of cholera vaccines that JDC led in Bangladesh, and on his further analysis of herd protection in the trial data.","The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.","2007","11","Ira M Longini","IML",6,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
