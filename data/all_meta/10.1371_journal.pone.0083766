All the research interests (including research results, patents, products, employment, consultancy, etc.) belong to the Institute of Medical Biology, according to the contract between Institute of Medical Biology and Novel Bioinformatics Co. Both Dai Chen and Mingfei Feng from Novel Bioinformatics Co., who are the analysts, assume this microarray analytical work. They kindly re-analyzed the results of microarray assay according to the reviewers during major revision, so all authors agree to put their name into the authors list.
