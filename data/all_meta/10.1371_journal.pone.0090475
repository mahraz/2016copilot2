A company called Videx Canada was incorporated for this when the manuscript was submitted to PLOS ONE. However, at present Videx Canada no longer exists. The version of the frailty index presented here was not the one that Videx aimed to commercialize. Videx Canada played no role in the design, data collection or analyses of the data published in this manuscript and had no role in the decision to publish or preparation of the manuscript. Kenneth Rockwood was associated with Videx Canada, but received no funding while it existed. The commercial viability of the Frailty Index based on a Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment is currently under internal review by the Dalhousie University Industry Liaison Office.","2014","03","Lindsay M K Wallace","LMKW",7,TRUE,4,2,4,7,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,0,NA,FALSE
