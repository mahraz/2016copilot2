PWP performed many of the activity assays, purified the proteins for activity and binding assays, and crystallized SULT1C2 with PAP and PCP. LD purified and crystallized all other proteins whose structures are reported here. RN performed structure, binding, and activity profile analysis. WT solved the structure of SULT1C2 with PAP and PCP, and performed structural analysis. AD helped with X-ray data collection and crystallization, and solved the structures of SULTs 1B1, 1C1, 1C2, and 4A1. PL generated all the expression clones. FM performed computational analysis of SULT4A1 and SULT1C2 with PAP and PCP, and PCBs. JT contributed to data analysis and the manuscript.
