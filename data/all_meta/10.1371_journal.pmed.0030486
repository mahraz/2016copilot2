DSS, BG, NS, AJ, YS, JWS, AFG, and JDM analyzed the data. KMF, CLL, MW, OIO, and DME enrolled patients. DSS, BG, MS, CMP, JRP, KMF, YS, DME, JWS, AFG, and JDM contributed to writing the paper. DSS performed most of the experiments as part of his PhD thesis. LG helped analyze the microarray expression data and wrote the software that was used for part of the analysis. CML and DME were involved with all the experiments using DNA from breast tissue acquired by FNA and assisted in summarizing the methylation data. CMP provided advice on the array analysis. OIO, CMP, and RN organized the collection of breast tumor samples from an ethnically diverse patient population and did preliminary analyses on the data before contributing the samples to the larger study included in this paper. JP and YK performed the array CGH studies at Stanford. WG provided part of the gene expression data for the primary lung tumors and corresponding normal tissues. Some of the methylation studies were performed in AFGs lab. JDM served as supervising mentor for DSS during his thesis work. JDM worked with DSS to develop the project and to assemble the resources used in testing the various methylation markers. Nearly all of the funding for this project came from JDMs peer reviewed grants and private foundation grants.","none","2006","12","David S Shames","DSS",21,TRUE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
