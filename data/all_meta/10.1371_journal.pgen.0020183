SSL and DHK carried out initial pathogenesis and longevity experiments with sek-1, and VR and DHK carried out initial microarray analysis of sek-1–regulated genes. ERT carried out all subsequent pathogenesis assays with pmk-1; microarray and qRT-PCR analysis of pmk-1, daf-16, and pathogen-treated worms. SSL performed all lifespan experiments and associated statistical analysis.
