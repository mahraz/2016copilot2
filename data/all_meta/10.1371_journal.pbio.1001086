Performed the experiments: BC FDF EC PG GR. Analyzed the data: BC AW FMM RLR LG DB MP TB. Contributed reagents/materials/analysis tools: AW MP TB JR GC NF MEB AA. Wrote the paper: BC AW NF MEB AA. BC performed experiments on mammalian cells and mice; AW bioinformatic analyses for nucleosome positioning and modeling; FDF, EC, PG, and BC experiments on yeast; BC and FMM bioinformatics for proteome analysis; BC, RLR, GR, and MP transcriptome analyses of mammalian cells; and LG and DB high-throughput sequencing and transcriptome analyses of yeast cells. BC, MEB, and AA formulated the hypotheses. BC, MP, TB, JR, NF, GC, MEB, and AA analyzed the results (mammalian transcriptomics, MP; proteomics, TB; high throughput sequencing and transcriptome analyses of yeast cells, JR; bioinformatic analyses for nucleosome positioning and modeling, NF; experiments on yeast, GC; experiments on mammalian cells and mice, BC, MEB, and AA). MEB and AA coordinated the whole work.","The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.","2011","06","Barbara Celona","BC",17,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
