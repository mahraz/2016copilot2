Hoffmann-La Roche. To be more precise, all the work contained herewith in this manuscript was performed exclusively outside of the Genentech environment at F. Hoffmann-La Roche locations based in Palo Alto California USA and the Basel Switzerland facilities. The inclusion of Genentech Inc however, is utilized to identify the current location of the senior author, Christopher J. Del Nagro, who is currently employed by F. Hoffmann-La Roche at the South San Francisco California USA, Genentech site. It is at the Genentech site where the entirety of the manuscript preparation was performed. To further illuminate the previously stated potential conflicts of interest, the authors restate here in further detail that they have read the journal’s policy and have the following potential conflicts to report: they re-affirm that all listed authors are current or former employees of F. Hoffmann-La Roche, having performed research for F. Hoffmann-La Roche during gainful employment in either Basel Switzerland, Palo Alto California USA or Genentech in South San Francisco USA.","2013","11","Cheng-Ping Mao","CPM",6,TRUE,2,3,3,1,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,0,NA,FALSE
