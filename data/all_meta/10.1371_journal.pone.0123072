Schramm) and their personnel planned and conducted the study, including data collection, setting up the analysis plan and performing all analyses as well as discussing the results. Roche Pharma AG, Germany has provided dedicated grants to the institution (University Hospital Würzburg) for external measurements of hepcidin-25 and for staff support. Roche Pharma AG had no influence on the conduct of the study, data analysis, and interpretation of the results. The data are owned by the authors and Roche Pharma AG holds no database. Support of the study by Roche Pharma AG does not alter the authors' adherence to PLOS ONE policies on sharing data and materials. The authors themselves have no relevant conflicts of interest to declare with the results presented and discussed in the manuscript. However, more than 5 years ago (2008), Dr. Wagner received travel grants and speakers honoraria from Roche Pharma AG, Germany.","2015","04","Martin Wagner","MW",10,TRUE,3,NA,2,6,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,0,NA,FALSE
