Szymkowski is the Senior Director of Bio-therapeutics at Xencor: the company that manufactures the anti-TNF biologic XPro1595 used in our study. Dr. Szymkowskis role on this project was to provide council on dosing and to provide a background on XPro1595s unique mechanism of action. Dr. Szymkowski played no role in data collection or statistical comparisons. Because the neuroscience field is outside his area of expertise, he did not provide any council or shade any interpretation of XPro1595s effects on neurologic function. For these reasons, the authors that Dr. Szymkowskis status as an author for this study is appropriate and in no way compromised or biased the experimental results or interpretations. Dr. Hafiz Mohmmad Abdul is now employed by Proteostasis Therapeutics, Inc. Dr. Mohmmad Abdul took this position after the data in our article were collected and interpreted. Please note that Proteostasis Therapeutics Inc had no role whatsoever in any portion of this study. The corresponding author of this article, Dr. Chris Norris, currently serves as an Academic Editor at PLoS ONE. This does not alter the authors adherence to all the PLoS ONE policies on sharing data and materials.","2012","05","Diana M Sama","DMS",7,TRUE,3,5,2,2,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,0,NA,FALSE
