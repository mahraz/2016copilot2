Wrote the manuscript: JLL MRJ ML MHS TJT JRM CDC.","The authors have read the Journal's policy and have the following conflicts: 1. CDC has a financial interest (stock ownership) in Renmatix, Inc. Renmatix is developing technology to produce sugars from biomass via abiotic processes. He acquired stock by exercising options awarded to him as compensation for providing technical advice in the early history of the company. He no longer has any relationship with the company other than stock ownership. It is unlikely that he would be unable to affect the future value of the stock through this publication, even if he were motivated to do so. 2. CDC is the Director of the Institute for a Secure and Sustainable Environment which provided funding to support JLL through institutional funds that he has been entrusted to administer. This does not alter the authors' adherence to all the PLOS ONE policies on sharing data and materials.","2013","10","Jessica L Linville","JLL",8,TRUE,4,4,8,7,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,1,"2",FALSE
