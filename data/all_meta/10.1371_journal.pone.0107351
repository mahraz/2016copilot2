The collaboration did not involve any financial agreement between the two parties. The core full length RNA/cDNA enrichment technology and related product is owned by Thermo Fisher Scientific and was modified/applied to Ion Torrent “Full-Length” RNA-seq by Pei-zhong Tang an employee of Thermo Fisher Scientific. Antje Taliana and Scott Backer were employees of Life Technologies (now Thermo Fisher Scientific) at the time of the study but are no longer with the company.
