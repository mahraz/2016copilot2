Cellectis SA supported the project in the form of a participation to ZR salary and to the running cost of the project and provided research material (i.e. the TALEN). SA and PD participated to the design of the TALEN and the technical choices related to gene targeting and to mutation detection. SA and PD did not participate to the choice of the gene to target nor did they participate to data collection or the analysis made to characterize the isolated mutants. SA and PD did not participate to the writing of the manuscript. This does not alter the authors adherence to PLOS ONE policies on sharing data and materials.","2015","07","Zlatko Radev","ZR",9,TRUE,9,4,7,7,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,0,NA,FALSE
