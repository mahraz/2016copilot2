The company has agreed for the authors to access i-Paths i-Server interface API and digital slides. In addition to being head of research within the university, Peter Hamilton is also the founder and shareholder in i-Path Diagnostics. Access to the i-Path i-Server was not the main focus of research in this paper. The emphasis of the paper is on multitouch interaction with digital slides which is an entirely university/academic exercise and does not financially benefit the company i-Path Diagnostics Ltd in any way. In this study, the authors are using the following i-Path products: i) i-Path i-Server interface API and ii) digital slide hosting service. This does not alter the authors adherence to all the PLoS ONE policies on sharing data and materials.","2012","01","Yinhai Wang","YW",5,TRUE,2,3,2,5,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,0,NA,FALSE
