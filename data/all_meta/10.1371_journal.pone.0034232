AstraZeneca had no direct or indirect influence on the study design, the data collection/analysis or preparation of the manuscript. One of the co-authors (GT) is an AstraZeneca employee, but he also has a position as acting professor at the authors' department. His relation to AstraZeneca had no influence on his contribution as a co-author to this manuscript. This does not alter the authors' adherence to all the PLoS ONE policies on sharing data and materials.","2012","03","Reza Karimi","RK",5,TRUE,5,5,5,5,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,0,NA,FALSE
