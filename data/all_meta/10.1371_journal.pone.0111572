The authors would like to clarify that Alia Point Awa Nursery is not a commercial awa nursery. Alia Point Awa Nursery provides awa cuttings and plants to research and educational institutions including University of Hawaii, Manoa, University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, Canada, and Como Park Zoo and Conservatory, Saint Paul, MN, free of charge or for the cost of shipping only. Recorded awa costs for 2012 and 2013 were $60 and $50, respectively. The role of Alia Point Awa Nursery is described by Vincent Lebot in Ethnobotany Research & Applications Vol 2/i as a site for preservation of Hawaiian cultivars of awa / kava. The first recorded DNA analysis of Hawaiian awa was performed at Alia Point Awa Nursery and reported in Lebot, et. al. (1999) Morphological Phytochemical and genetic variation in Hawaiian cultivars of awa. Economic Botany, 53 (4): 407â€“418. Please let the authors know if you would like any additional information about the status of Alia Point Awa Nursery. This does not alter the authors adherence to PLOS ONE policies on sharing data and materials.","2014","11","Amanda C Martin","ACM",4,TRUE,4,2,4,NA,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,0,NA,FALSE
