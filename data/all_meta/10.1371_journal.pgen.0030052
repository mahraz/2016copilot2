The intergenerational instability data was collected and analysed by LF, AN, and GG. The mouse phenotype was assessed by AN and AH. The analysis of alternative splicing in the transgenic mice was designed by MGP and GG. The molecular analyses of alternative splicing were performed by MGP and AH. The manuscript was written by MGP and GG. CJ and AM contributed with financial means.
