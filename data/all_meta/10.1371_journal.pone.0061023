The authors have read the journals policy and have the following conflicts: Liam Heaney has received grant funding from Medimmune, Novartis UK, Genentech Inc, and Glaxo Smith Kline, has taken part in Advisory Boards and given lectures at meetings supported by Glaxo Smith Kline, Merck Sharpe & Dohme, Nycomed, Novartis and Astra Zeneca. He has received support funding to attend International Respiratory meetings (Astra Zeneca, Chiesi, Novartis and Glaxo Smith Kline) and has taken part in asthma clinical trials (GSK and Genentech) for which his Institution was remunerated. None of these activities have any direct relationship to the content of this manuscript. Michael Shields has no direct competing interests relating to this study but does declare that he has delivered lectures at educational events and received honoraria from GlaxoSmithKline, AstraZeneca, Merck Sharp & Dohme, Novartis and Alk Abello. In addition, he has received educational grant support to attend the British Thoracic and European Respiratory Societies annual meetings from Novartis and GlaxoSmithKline.
