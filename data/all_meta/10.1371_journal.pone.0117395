While the authorship team has no commercial conflict of interest, the production of a manuscript regarding patient experiences may require acknowledging that most authors have employment relationships with the entities studied in this paper (4 VA healthcare centers and 1 independent nonprofit Health Care for the Homeless Program). Essentially, all but three authors currently have or previously enjoyed a direct employment relationship with either one of the 4 VA institutions or the single non-VA Healthcare for the Homeless Program in this study. Among the remaining three individuals (Holt, Pollio, Whelan), all received some form of compensation for research services from one of the institutions in this study.
