The acoustic recording system employed in the research presented in this paper was developed by Loggerhead Instruments. DAM in no way influenced any aspect of this research as a result of his position at Loggerhead and is a long-standing, well respected member of the acoustic community both academically and through Loggerhead. Further, the integration of the Loggerhead acoustic recording system occurred while DAM was still faculty at the University of South Florida.
