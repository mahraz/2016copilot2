Performed the experiments: CS AH. Analyzed the data: CS LGA DEW GdPG. Wrote the paper: CS LGA GdPG.","CS, DEW, AH and GdPG have declared that no competing interests exist. LGA has delared XBio Inc. and CONICET affiliation. A patent has been filed (PCT/US10/58657), related to the use of the oligomers as a therapeutic vaccine for HPV and this was already published (reference 51). LGA is an employee from the National Science Council, but working within XBio. It is a program from the government to support biotech startups. Therefore, he has double affiliation. The work presented has no commercial interest, and it is independent from the patent application that is mentioned (which was also published in a widely distributed peer review journal). This does not alter the authors adherence to all the PLoS ONE policies on sharing data and materials.","2012","05","Clara Smal","CS",5,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
