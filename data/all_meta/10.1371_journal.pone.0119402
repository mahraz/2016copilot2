Wrote the paper: CW BK JAS RdM.","There exists no competing interests and there is no financial intent to market the results of this manuscript somehow. Most of the results were produced at the University of Applied Sciences in Krems, Austria where the first author (B. Kreiseder) was employed before she changed to SeaLife Pharma GmbH. The last author (C. Wiesner) is employed at the University in Krems and at SeaLife Pharma GmbH. Just very few results were produced at SeaLife Pharma mainly to finalize the manuscript. The research of SeaLife Pharma GmbH focuses on the production (isolation) of anti-infective molecules such as Anthraquinone-Derivatives for the treatment of MRSA. There is no interest in cancer research. Up to now, SeaLife Pharma has no products on the market. On behalf of all authors, I declare that there are no competing interests for the purposes of transparency. We confirm that this does not alter our adherence to PLOS ONE policies on sharing data and materials.","2015","03","Birgit Kreiseder","BK",10,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
