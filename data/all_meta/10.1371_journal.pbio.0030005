MPR and WGS determined the crystal structure and investigated possible structural homologies. HI and MA designed the transcription templates for the SARS s2m RNA and performed the biochemical analyses. RB and DH performed the viral and cellular genomic sequence analyses and called our attention to the striking conservation and biological importance of the SARS s2m RNA.","The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.","2004","12","Michael P Robertson","MPR",6,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
