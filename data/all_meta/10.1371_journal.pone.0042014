The amount was solely spent for the process of genotyping and for acquisition of the blood samples. None of the money went directly to any of the authors or to any particular individual involved in the process of data aquisition (i.e. as salary). This was an unrestricted funding. Novartis does not expect data in return. All data will be available to the whole scientific community.
