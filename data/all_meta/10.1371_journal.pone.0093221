Some of these, which are owned by Cornell Research Foundation (CRF) are nonexclusively licensed to General Electric. As an inventor of these patents, DY, AR, and CH are entitled to a share of any compensation which CRF may receive from its commercialization of these patents. As of April 2009, CH has signed away any financial benefit including royalties and any other proceeds related to the patents or patent applications.
