Wrote the paper: TIHP MAC MD.","Dr. Teoh is a pathologist at Labtests, New Zealand, and he was the neuropathologist in charge of the authors′ epilepsy specimens used in this study. His pathological reports were part of the Auckland District Health Boards regulation for epilepsy surgeries, and these reports were also vital in deciding which cultures will proceed in this study. As the patients fully consented the use of their tissue and their pathological reports for the authors research, there was no conflict of interest in this collaboration regarding data used in our studies. Furthermore, there was no commercial interest involved in sharing of the authors′ data. Therefore, this does not alter the authors adherence to all the PLoS ONE policies on sharing data and materials.","2012","06","Thomas In-Hyeup Park","TIHP",9,TRUE,6,2,5,3,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,0,NA,FALSE
