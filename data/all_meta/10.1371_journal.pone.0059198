Several patents have been applied on the recombinant attenuated B. pertussis strains, as well as on M2e as a potential vaccine antigen. These patent rights are owned by the institutions to which the authors are affiliated. Although a small part of the work (M2e-VLP construction) was done in collaboration with SanofiPasteur, this does not alter the authors adherence to all the PLOS ONE policies on sharing data and materials.","2013","03","Hana Kammoun","HK",10,TRUE,3,6,5,3,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,0,NA,FALSE
