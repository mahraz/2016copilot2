Wrote the paper: JWB CKS DMA ICG JMW KAM RMA IV LC DRS ATT RBH.","JWB, IV, and DRS are employees of the Promega Corporation and DRS owns stock, whose company partly funded this study. RBH received funds from the Promega Corporation to collect human samples, prepare genomic DNA for microsatellite testing, and perform immunohistochemistry for MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2. The long mononucleotide markers were compared to current standards â€ the Promega MSI Analysis System which is widely used for microsatellite testing and immunohistochemistry. The purpose of this study was to determine whether the long mononucleotides were more sensitive to microsatellite instability than the current standards. The long mononcleotides are not part of any product marketed by the Promega Corporation or any of its competitors. There are no patents, products in development or marketed products to declare. The authors adhere to the PLOS ONE policies on sharing data and materials; long mononucleotide primers will be freely available to investigators through a Material Transfer Agreement with Promega.","2015","08","Jeffery W Bacher","JWB",12,TRUE,6,10,12,12,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,0,NA,FALSE
