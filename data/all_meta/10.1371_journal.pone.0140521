Dr. Widrick receives consulting income from Acceleron Pharma Inc. Dr. Sanchez and Dr. Rutkove are named as inventors on patent applications in the field of electrical impedance. Neither the patent entitled Electrical impedance myography or the patent entitled Device for performing electrical impedance myography are directly relevant to this publication, as both relate to the development of an automated device for human use. However, since both are in the field of electrical impedance, the authors have disclosed them. Acceleron Pharma Inc. provided the activin type IIB receptor RAP-031 used to conduct this study under a material transfer agreement. This does not alter the authors adherence to PLOS ONE policies on sharing data and materials. Data is freely available to other researchers in the body of the manuscript and the supporting information.
