Smith is named as an inventor on two patents held by the University of Oxford on the use of folic acid to treat Alzheimers disease (US6008221; US6127370); under the Universitys rules he could benefit financially if the patent is exploited. Drs. Refsum and A. D. Smith report having in the past received speaking honoraria from Recip AB, the company that donated the vitamin tablets, and from Axis-Shield, who make the equipment used to assay homocysteine.
