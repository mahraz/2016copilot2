Three of the coauthors (RMM, CSD, DWC) are also undertaking other polar bear population genetics projects using medium-density SNP arrays independently from USGS, and the authors recognize that this may be perceived as a competing interest. None of the possible perceived competing interests above has influenced the decision to submit this reanalysis.","2016","03","Ren√© M Malenfant","R√MM",4,TRUE,2,1,1,1,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,0,NA,FALSE
