ØE and ABM received funding from the Research Council of Norway. Ã∼E has been acting as expert witness and as consultant for PHARMAQ. ABM declares no competing interests. PHARMAQ holds a patent application entitled “New ethiological agent” and an exclusive license on the use of the GF-1 cell line. However, in direct collaboration between PHARMAQ and external parties, a time limited licensing for research purposes can be possible. There are no products against infections with ASCV licensed in any markets. This does not alter the authors' adherence to all the PLOS ONE policies on sharing data and materials, apart from the GF-1 cell line being for exclusive use by PHARMAQ.","2014","09","Aase B Mikalsen","ABM",7,FALSE,5,7,7,NA,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,0,NA,FALSE
