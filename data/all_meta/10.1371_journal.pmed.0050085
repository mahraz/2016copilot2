NB, RA, SG, JB, HA, UM, and KAK collected data or did experiments for the study. KAK, NB, RA, SG, HA, and UM analyzed the data. KAK and NB wrote the first draft of the paper. NB, RA, SG, HA, RAD, UM, and RW contributed to writing the paper. SG generated cancer prone mouse colonies, isolated mouse pancreatic tumor specimens, developed mouse pancreatic duct cells, and conducted expression array studies. JB was responsible for coordinating the in vivo studies utilizing PDAC mouse models, maintaining model colonies, collecting sample tissue following injection of PTP and imaging, and analyzing experimental results via histology, etc. following imaging. RADs laboratory built and characterized the genetically engineered mouse model of pancreas cancer that enabled the study. UM performed in vivo/ex vivo imaging. RW performed/supervised the majority of in vivo imaging studies.","The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.","2008","04","Kimberly A Kelly","KAK",9,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
