Wrote the paper: KK HT TK.","Ms. Akiko Wakamoto, a co-author of this article, is employed by a company, DNA Chip Research Incorporation (JAPAN). The other authors collaborated with Ms. Wakamoto to construct cDNA microarray and perform hybridization. Actually, she printed cDNA subclones that we sent to her on the chips, and hybridized the cDNA microarray chips to labeled cDNA target that we sent to her, at the cost price. She sent back all the hybridization data and microarrays to our lab, after the experiments. There is no consultancy, patents, products in development, or marketed products etc, that the company has related to our article. The authors hereby confirm that the Ms. Wakamotos employment does not alter at all our adherence to all the PLoS ONE policies on sharing data and materials, as detailed online in the ‘guide for authors’.","2010","02","Kumi Kaneko","KK",11,TRUE,3,6,5,3,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,0,NA,FALSE
