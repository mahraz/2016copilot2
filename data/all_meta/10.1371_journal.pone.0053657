Dr. William Warren is employed in Sanofi Pasteur; however, this work, supported by Department of Defense with P.E. Kolattukudy as the Principal Investigator, had nothing to do with the activities of Sanofi Pasteur and there are no financial or intellectual property arrangements with Sanofi Pasteur. Dr. Pawar moved on from Sanofi Pasteur to a non-profit Cancer Research Center. Thus, no conflict of interest exists in either case. This does not alter the authorsâ€™ adherence to all the PLOS ONE policies and sharing data and materials.","2013","01","Nidhi Kapoor","NK",6,TRUE,2,2,2,4,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,0,NA,FALSE
