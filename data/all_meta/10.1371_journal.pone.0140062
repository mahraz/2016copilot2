Development of a non-invasive device for hemoglobin and inflammation determination: MO.","This study was funded in part by MBR Optical Systems, Wuppertal, Germany. Juliana Casimiro de Almeida and Marion Olbert are employed by MBR Optical Systems. This work will be used in partial fulfillment of the requirements that will allow JCA to obtain the PhD degree in the University of Paderborn, Germany. MO is responsible for the development of a non-invasive device for the determination of hemoglobin and inflammation. JCA was responsible for the tests of this device. The results obtained with this device are neither presented nor described in this manuscript. Therefore, the involvement of the two employees of MBR Optical Systems has no bearing on the presented results. There are no further patents, products in development or marketed products to declare. This does not alter the authors adherence to all the PLOS ONE policies on sharing data and materials.","2015","10","Juliana Casimiro de Almeida","JCDA",9,TRUE,3,5,2,6,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,0,NA,FALSE
