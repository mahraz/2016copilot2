After he graduated in 2013, Dr. Chigutsa moved to Eli Lilly and Company as post-doctoral fellow. However, Eli Lilly and Company was not involved in this work, since the Danish Ministry of Foreign Affairs (DANIDA, DFC file no. 09-026RH) through the Denmarks International Development Cooperation entirely supported this study.
