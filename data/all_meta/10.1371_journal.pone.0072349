Regarding selective lysis of cells by ionic surfactants (WO2012168003 A1); 2. Regarding selective lysis of cells (WO2011070507 A1). The Polaris technology originated at Philips Research and was transferred in August 2011 to Biocartis for further development and commercialization. BM and RP were originally working on the Polaris technology within Philips but joined Biocartis in August 2011 to finish the development of the Polaris system. Once the assay was optimized the protocol was transferred to Jeroen Bosh hospital (AB and AL) and VUMC (PS, AC and MB) for independent evaluation of the technology. Co-authors BM, RP and GM are employed by Biocartis NV. Co-authors SN, ID and PW are employed by Philips Research. Philips, and later on, Biocartis, kindly provided Polaris and MolYsis components for this study. There are no further patents, products in development or marketed products to declare. This does not alter the authors adherence to all the PLOS ONE policies on sharing data and materials.","2013","08","Anne J M Loonen","AJML",11,TRUE,4,3,5,5,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,0,NA,FALSE
