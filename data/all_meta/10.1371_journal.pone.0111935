It was used to buy contrast media (Gd-EOB-DTPA (PrimovistÂ®)) for the MRI-examination of the patients. This contrast medium is a specific tool in imaging liver lesions since it is metabolized by the hepatocytes. It is officially approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) as well as by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the USA and the authors currently use it daily in clinical routine. The funders had no role in study design, data collection and analysis, decision to publish or preparation of the manuscript. The authors employments were not paid by the research grant. None of the authors received personal funding for this work and therefore no personal competing interests exist. This funding does not alter the authors adherence to PLOS ONE policies on sharing data and materials.","2014","11","Bettina Maiwald","BM",4,TRUE,2,1,3,4,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,0,NA,FALSE
