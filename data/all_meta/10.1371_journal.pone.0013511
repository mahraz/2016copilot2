Resistentia Pharmaceuticals AB previously employed Åsa Jansson, Bingze Xu and Niclas Rydell. In 2008, Resistentia Pharmaceuticals AB was closed down completely. This does not alter the authors' adherence to all the PLoS ONE policies on sharing data and materials, as detailed online in the guide for authors. Medical Inflammation Research Division, Department of Medical Biochemistry and Biophysics, Karolinska Institute has taken over the project completely and continues the research. None of the past members of Resistentia Pharmaceuticals AB are involved in this project from 2008 onwards.","2010","10","Kutty Selva Nandakumar","KSN",6,TRUE,6,4,5,3,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,0,NA,FALSE
