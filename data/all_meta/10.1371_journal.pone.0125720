Greeneridge conducted this research under contract with the Shell Exploration & Production Company (SEPCO). WEST Inc. (CSN and TLM) was sub-contracted for help with statistics, and Scripps Institution of Oceanography (AMT and DM) was sub-contracted for help with automated whale call and airgun pulse detection, algorithms that have been previously published in the peer-reviewed open literature. Throughout the study design and data analyses, SEPCO (AMM) provided suggestions, as any co-author would, but played no role in the decision to publish, the determination of the final results and conclusions of the study, or the preparation of the manuscript until the final editorial stages.
