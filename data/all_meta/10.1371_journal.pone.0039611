There is a potential conflict of interest since the main author of this systematic review (KTA) has published articles that mention a CAM questionnaire. However, to minimize this potential bias, another member of the research team has been involved in the identification of studies, the extraction of data and the quality assessment. This does not alter the authors adherence to all the PLoS ONE policies on sharing data and materials.","2012","06","Karine Toupin April","KTA",10,TRUE,10,4,5,10,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,0,NA,FALSE
