Lewinsohn and Deborah A. Lewinsohn have the following conflicts and conflict resolution. DML and DAL are co-inventors on US patent 7,842,299 regarding use of Esx J, PE9, and PE_PGRS42 as CD8 antigens for TB diagnostics and vaccines. AERAS Foundation has licensed use of Esx J, PE9, and PE_PGRS42 for TB vaccine development from OHSU. DML and DAL receive royalty income for this license. Finally, DML and DAL hold financial interest in ViTi Corp and ViTi Corp has licensed use of Esx J, PE9, and PE_PGRS42 as CD8 antigens for TB diagnostic development. This does not alter the authors adherence to all the PLoS ONE policies on sharing data and materials. All others authors do not hold any conflict of interest as defined by PLoS ONE policy. Required public discloser language required by OHSU follows: Aeras TB Vaccine Foundation, a non-profit organization has licensed technology from OHSU of which David M. Lewinsohn and Deborah A. Lewinsohn are inventors. The technology is used in this research. This potential conflict has been reviewed and managed by OHSU. Furthermore, OHSU and David M. Lewinsohn and Deborah A. Lewinsohn have a financial interest in ViTi, a company that may have a commercial interest in the results of this research and technology. This potential individual and institutional conflict of interest has been reviewed and managed by OHSU.","2013","06","David M Lewinsohn","DML",9,TRUE,5,4,5,3,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,0,NA,FALSE
