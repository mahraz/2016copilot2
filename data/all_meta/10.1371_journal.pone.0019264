For these studies, MediProPharma provided TGen with adequate amounts of each compound, their data determining the IC50s for these compounds against DYRK1A, and paid TGens reagent costs to analyze these compounds. The specific experiments performed were conceived, carried out, and analyzed by TGen with no subsequent input from MediProPharma. Proprietary MPP compounds are available from MediProPharma through completion of a material transfer agreement.
