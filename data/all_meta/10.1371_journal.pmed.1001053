CG has been involved in the process of preparing and developing the National Pandemic Plan since 2002. During the pandemic CG was in charge of the coordination of the Executive Committee for outbreaks and health emergencies in Chile. This committee was responsible for making decisions and implementing measures for prevention and control. Also, until August 2010, CG participated in the implementation of IHR 2005 in Chile. During the pandemic, the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) provided funds to the Ministry of Health and the Institute of Public Health for studies and improvement of epidemiological surveillance. CG was not responsible for managing these resources. PAHO also delivered primers and other supplies for the laboratory diagnosis of influenza (RT-PCR). They provided computers for influenza sentinel centers for improving the opportunity of reporting, which also included the development of a web application for online notification. CG was a member of the Review Committee on the Functioning of the International Health Regulations (2005) and on Pandemic Influenza A (H1N1), 2009, between April 2010 and April 2011. The result of the work of this committee was submitted to the World Health Assembly in May 2011. In December 2010 (29 November to 15 December) CG was part of a mission to assess the health sector response to pandemic influenza A (H1N1) in Mexico. This mission was requested by the Ministry of Health of Mexico to PAHO. Other mission members were Dr. Jarbas Barbosa (Brazil), Dr. Hande Harmanci (WHO), Dr. Juan Pablo Sarmiento (Colombia), Dr. Ronald St. John (Canada). For this work CG received airfare and per diem supplemented by the standards of PAHO. CG has been invited to present the Chilean experience during the influenza pandemic 2009 in various national and international conferences. CG currently works at the Universidad del Desarrollo (Santiago, Chile) as a teacher and researcher; also at EPI-Sur Consultants, an institution dedicated to providing advisory services and consulting in the field of international health for agencies, governments, and NGOs. EPI-Sur Consultants have worked for PAHO in the field of infectious diseases (not on influenza). VJL has received unrelated research funding from GlaxoSmithKline. JT received a travel grant from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (via an Influenza Cooperative Agreement Grant) to attend the Options for the Control of Influenza VII conference in Hong Kong, 3–7 September 2010, to present a poster entitled Fatal pandemic influenza A(H1N1)2009 infections in HIV-infected persons, South Africa. All other authors have declared that no competing interests exist.","2011","07","Maria D Van Kerkhove","MDVK",42,FALSE,5,NA,7,5,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,2,"9;38",TRUE
