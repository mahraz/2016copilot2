Performed the experiments: EM JPR SDK. Analyzed the data: TDM MV SD GM GT. Wrote the paper: TDM.","The authors have read the journal's policy and have the following conflicts: the authors wish to let it be known that GT, WVC and JPR are or were employees or consultants of/for MDX Health, an epigenetics diagnostics company, but that this company will not gain or lose from the publication of this manuscript as it is not involved in the market of MBD-based enrichment kits. MDX Health partially funded this study to improve their own experimental procedures with the generated knowledge. GT was an employee of MDX Health (then OncoMethylome Sciences) until 2009; WVC was an employee of MDX Health and is currently CSO on a consultancy basis for MDX Health; JPR is an employee of MDX Health who has been detached to Ghent University. This does not alter the authors' adherence to all the PLOS ONE policies on sharing data and materials.","2013","03","Tim De Meyer","TDM",10,TRUE,3,3,5,1,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,0,NA,FALSE
