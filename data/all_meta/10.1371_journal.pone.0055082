This study was supported in part by a grant-in-aid from Nikon Corporation. Hirofumi Shiono and Yasujiro Kiyota are employed by Nikon Instruments. Ryuji Kato is one of the main investigators of 12 patents (pending) related to basic technologies of “algorithms of cellular image processing. Hirofumi Shiono, is one of the inventors of the hardware we used in our research, “BioStaion CT” which is the automatic cell culture system, and a member of this collaborative project with Nagoya Univ. The BioStation CT and relating software are marketed products of Nikon Corporation. Although the system and the software were used in this study, the result of this research does not depend on the system and the software. He is one of the inventors of related 12 patents. Yasujiro Kiyota, is one of the inventors of the hardware we used in our research work. There are no further patents, products in development or marketed products to declare. This does not alter our adherence to all the PLoS ONE policies on sharing data and materials, as detailed online in the guide for authors.","2013","02","Fumiko Matsuoka","FM",8,TRUE,4,1,3,5,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,0,NA,FALSE
