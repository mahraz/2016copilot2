Yoshida. Therefore, this study neither received any funding from the companies to which the above three authors belong, nor did their affiliating companies per se play any role in this research except that they sent their staff (the above three authors) to the laboratory of Teruhiko Yoshida under a research contract paid by Yoshida's grant. There is no competing interests involved between Teruhiko Yoshida and these companies, including intellectual properties. The authors also confirm that they can adhere to all the PLoS ONE policies on sharing data and materials.","2010","07","Siew-Kee Low","SKL",17,FALSE,9,5,12,5,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,0,NA,FALSE
