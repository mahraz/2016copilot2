Crawford are affiliated to Zacharon Pharmaceuticals Inc. It could be reasonably perceived by an outside party that Zacharon Parmaceuticals could have interfered with objective analysis of the data they produced. However, all samples from the University of Manchester were blinded before sending to Zacharon Pharmaceuticals for biochemical analysis. Therefore Zacharon Pharmaceuticals had no control over the interpretation of the data produced.
