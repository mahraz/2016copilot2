Performed the experiments: LN BM CR TH. Analyzed the data: LN BM. Wrote the paper: LN AG.","The authors have the following interests: Construction of plasmid vectors and Pichia auxotrophy strains was co-financed by VTU Technology. VTU Technology is one of many international groups employing the described strains and vectors in their labs and all described strains and materials are available from Graz University of Technology for a modest fee covering costs for production and distribution of the materials. Some of the vectors are distributed by DNA2.0 as vector backbones with synthetic genes cloned into these expression plasmids which were designed for general FTO. However, there was no financial support by DNA2.0 in any means to the development of the described strains and vectors. There is no dependency from DNA2.0. This does not alter the authors’ adherence to all the PLoS ONE policies on sharing data and materials.","2012","06","Laura Näätsaari","LN",6,TRUE,5,4,2,2,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,0,NA,FALSE
