JDC, JMC, and LER are employed by APC Inc., Ankeny, IA, whose companies partly funded this study. Both, APC Europe, S.A. and APC Inc., manufactures and sells spray dried plasma. Joan Pujols, and David Torrallardona declare no conflict of interest. APC Inc and AP Europe, S.A. manufacture the following spray dried plasma products for swine use: AP820, AP820P, AP820B, AP920, AP920P, AP920B, Appetein (US Patent N° 6004576) and Appetein GS. However, any of these commercial products were used in this study because the spray dried plasma used in experiment 2 was produced at pilot plant level, as it is indicated in the manuscript. This does not alter the authors adherence to all the PLOS ONE policies on sharing data and materials.","2015","07","Javier Polo","JP",8,TRUE,1,1,1,1,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,3,"2;4;7",TRUE
