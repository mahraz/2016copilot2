He has received Honoraria from Cepheid and Hologic for giving talks on sexually transmitted infection (STI) molecular diagnostics and from Atlas Genetics for co-authoring a promotional article on STI point of care diagnostics. He has undertaken paid consultancy for work on Mycoplasma genitalium by Hologic. He has also received funding from the crown prosecution service for acting as an expert witness in an alleged sexual assault involving chlamydia. He is named on a patent, held by Imperial college London, for the use of Chlamydia Pgp3 antibody alone or in combination with other antigens to determine whether an individual is at risk of chronic sequelae following Chlamydia trachomatis infection. Patent name ‘Pgp3 alone or in combination with other antigen(s) antibody ELISA for Chlamydia trachomatis infection as prognostic test for infertility problems’ and patent application number 1111673.8. Rona Campbell is the Director of DECIPHer IMPACT, a not-for-profit spin out company wholly owned by the Universities of Bristol and Cardiff whose purpose is to license and support the roll-out of evidence based health promotion interventions. As a Director she is a member of the Board of the company and receives modest fees which are paid into an account at the University of Bristol and are used to fund research related activities. There are no further patents, products in development or marketed products to declare.
