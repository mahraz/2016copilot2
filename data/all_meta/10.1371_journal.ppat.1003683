Founded in 1945, the Noble Foundation conducts direct operations, including assisting farmers and ranchers, and conducting plant science research and agricultural programs, to enhance agricultural productivity regionally, nationally and internationally. The Foundation has no competing interests influencing the other authors (i.e. they support only work of RSN as an employee).
