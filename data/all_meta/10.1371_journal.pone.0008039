The role of the funding sources, Agria Animal Insurance Co. and the Swedish Kennel Club's Research Foundation, was solely financial, covering parts of the costs for blood collection materials, blood analyses and microarrays. They were not involved in any practical part of the study (collection), nor had they any influence or knowledge of the subsequent data analysis and interpretation, manuscript production or submission decision. The financial support for the study does not in any way prevent that the authors agree to make freely available any materials and information associated with their publication that are reasonably requested by others for the purpose of academic, non-commercial research, according to the PLoS ONE policies on sharing data and materials (as detailed in the guide for authors).","2009","11","Ragnvi Hagman","RH",3,TRUE,2,2,3,2,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,0,NA,FALSE
