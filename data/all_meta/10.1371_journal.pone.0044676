The authors are employed by the San Francisco Brain Research Institute & SAM Technology which are 100% supported by competing research grants from the U.S. Federal Government. Alan Gevins is the founder and owner of this private research laboratory which has been operating independently of the University of California San Francisco School of Medicine since 1980. The organization only performs research and offers no services or products. None of the authors perform consulting work. It is very unlikely that any corporation, investor, etc. would find it commercially worthwhile to buy or license the technologies that the authors have made to do their research. This does not alter the authors adherence to all the PLoS ONE policies on sharing data and materials.","2012","09","Alan Gevins","AG",3,TRUE,1,3,3,2,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,0,NA,FALSE
