The work reported here was supported in part by a research grant from ShelbyBioTech LLC and in part by the other sources listed in the funding section above. The City University of New York and Shelbyzyme LLC have patents related to Fabry disease and the corresponding author has a financial interest in these patents. The university, these corporations, and these funding agencies had no role in study design, data collection and analysis, decision to publish, or preparation of this manuscript. The university (Research Foundation of the City University of New York) was assigned ownership of the related U.S. Provisional Application No. 62/011,399, Purification of Recombinant Human Î±-Galactosidase A with C-terminal Truncation with Increased Activity. The university delegated all academic responsibilities to the authors and has no role in study design, data collection and analysis, decision to publish, or preparation of the manuscript. The university has submitted past applications to the U.S. Patent Office that have resulted in other issued or pending patents related to Fabry disease but these are not directly related to the pending manuscript (PONE-D-14-24242). This does not alter the authors adherence to all PLOS ONE policies on data sharing and materials.","2015","02","Mariam Meghdari","MM",5,TRUE,4,4,4,4,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,0,NA,FALSE
