The construction of subsamples with different levels of geographic dispersion was performed by SM and NAR. CZ contributed to the design and construction of the marker panels and to initial analysis with STRUCTURE; the full STRUCTURE analysis was designed by NAR and SM, with help from JKP, and was performed by SM with help from NAR. The regression analyses were designed by NAR with help from MWF, and were performed by NAR. The genetic/geographic distance analysis was designed by SR and NAR and was performed by SR. NAR wrote the paper with help from SR, JKP, and MWF.","The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.","2005","12","Noah A Rosenberg","NAR",6,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
