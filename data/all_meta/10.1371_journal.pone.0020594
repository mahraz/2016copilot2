This does not alter the authors' adherence to all the PLoS ONE policies on sharing data and materials. PerkinElmer currently holds patents for the technology used in the research, and the research documents the utility of PerkinElmer imaging agents and optical tomographic imaging technology in establishing a robust quantitative technique for full body, non-invasive fluorescence biodistribution assessment. PerkinElmer expects to further increase scientific interest in optical imaging in general and in imaging technology. The authors hold no patents relevant to the manuscript, and no patent applications are being submitted (or are planned to be submitted). No reimbursement or funding relating to potential patents has been received.","2011","06","Kristine O Vasquez","KOV",3,TRUE,1,2,2,2,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,0,NA,FALSE
