Performed the experiments: SMM. Analyzed the data: SMM CKH PB. Contributed reagents/materials/analysis tools: SMM CKH PB JH. Wrote the paper: SMM CKH PB JH PJF.","The project was partially funded by two commercial zoos: Boras Zoo, Sweden, and Ree Park, Denmark, both members of the African Lion Interest Group (ALIG) in Europe. None of the authors were directly involved with any employees at these zoos; however, the ALIG is interested in the results of this study for potential future sourcing of lions, and SMM and PJF have discussed the genetic origin of lions in South African small reserves with other ALIG members. The zoos had no role in study design, data collection and analysis, decision to publish, or preparation of the manuscript.
