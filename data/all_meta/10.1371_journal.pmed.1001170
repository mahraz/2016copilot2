ADI is committed to strengthening Alzheimer associations worldwide, raising awareness regarding dementia and Alzheimers disease, and advocating for more and better services for people with dementia and their caregivers. ADI is supported in part by grants from GlaxoSmithKline, Novartis, Lundbeck, Pfizer, and Eisai. Concerning the relationship with ADI, the 10/66 Dementia Research Group is an autonomous research network administered from the Institute of Psychiatry, Kings College London. Its relationship with Alzheimers Disease International is primarily around research dissemination; the 10/66 project website is hosted on the ADI server, and the cost of developing the site was met by ADI. 10/66 routinely makes a report of ongoing projects to the ADI Council, and have provided training at ADIs Alzheimer Universities. 10/66 have not received funding from ADI to conduct research, and ADI has no influence upon or input into 10/66 published research outputs. Martin Prince (but not the 10/66 DRG per se), through IoP/ KCL has received three small grants from ADI to fund researchers based at IoP/ KCL to work on the 2009, 2010, and 2011 World Alzheimer reports (not part of the present study). MD is a paid statistical reviewer for PLoS Medicine. All other authors have declared that no competing interests exist.","2012","02","Ana Luisa Sosa","ALS",19,FALSE,12,12,5,3,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,0,NA,FALSE
