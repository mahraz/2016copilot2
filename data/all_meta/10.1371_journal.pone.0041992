Tarik Issad has received in the past consulting fees from ADOCIA. The second part of the study (Fig. 3) was supported by a non-conditional grant from Sanofi-Aventis, the pharmaceutical company that marketed glargine. This part of the study was entirely performed in Tarik Issads laboratory at the Cochin Institute, in Paris, and in the contract signed between INSERM and Sanofi-Aventis, it is clearly specified that INSERM researchers retain all rights for publication of the results obtained in this study. Measurements of DNA synthesis (thymidine incorporation, Figure 4, panel C) were performed at Sanofi-Aventis in Frankfurt. Raw data obtained by Sanofi-Aventis on thymidine incorporation were analyzed independently by a biostatistician of the Proteomic Facility Core of the University Paris Descartes. These data were combined to those obtained in T. Issads laboratory in this collaborative publication. Glargine metabolites M1 (A21Gly-insulin), and 119 M2 (A21Gly,B30desThr-insulin), were made available by Process Development Biotechnology (Sanofi-Aventis, Frankfurt, Germany). Insulin Glargine is covered by claims of EP 0 368 187 81; Current patent holder: Sanofi-Aventis, Deutschland GmbH). The method for monitoring IR/IGF1R hybrids by BRET is covered by claims of FR 2824076/WO 020088752 (holder: Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique). There are no further patents, products in development or marketed products to declare. This does not alter the authors adherence to all the PLoS ONE policies on sharing data and materials, as detailed online in the guide for authors.","2012","07","C√©cile Pierre-Eugene","C√PE",8,TRUE,1,7,4,1,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,0,NA,FALSE
