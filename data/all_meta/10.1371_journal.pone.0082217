It is a non-profit veterinary organization owned by the farmers who receive the service from it. Hachaklait is not involved in the development of this vaccine and does not market the vaccine to farmers other than providing it to the farmers that own it. Additionally, Dr. MK was involved in this study as a student in Prof. EKs lab and not as an affiliate of the Hachaklait. For these reasons Dr. MK has no conflict of interest in this manuscript.","2013","12","Orly Aziz-Boaron","OAB",5,FALSE,5,4,3,2,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,0,NA,FALSE
