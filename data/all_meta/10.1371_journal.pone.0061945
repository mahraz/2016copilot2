Gary Andersen, Yvette Piceno, and Lauren Tom work at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, an institution holding a patent for the PhyloChip). Only T. DeSantis and G. Andersen receive monetary compensation related to the PhyloChip technology. Second Genome (www.secondgenome.com) is a human therapeutics company with a pipeline of intestinal microbiome modulators that impact infection, immunity and metabolic diseases. The publication of the lists of organisms with observed differences in the communities between the inside and outside of a brûlé does not influence the value of any of Second Genome’s therapeutic assets. Second Genome and the authors of this study both utilize molecular microbial profiling by hybridization (PhyloChip) among other techniques, and therefore image analysis and deconvolution software tools maintained by Todd DeSantis were applied to this environmental data set.","2013","04","Antonietta Mello","AM",9,TRUE,2,3,6,3,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,0,NA,FALSE
