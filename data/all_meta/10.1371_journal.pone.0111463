The research of the current study has no relation to the drug development or other activities performed by AstraZeneca and AstraZeneca had no influence on the initiation, conduct or interpretation of the study. The CALAB laboratory was overtaken by another company in 1997 but the laboratory database containing data from 1985 to 1996 was still owned and managed by Ingmar Jungner. Jungner donated the database to the Institute of Environmental Medicine in 2012. Ingmar Jungner is retired since many years and is not active in any business activities. He still is a member of the AMORIS Steering Committee.
