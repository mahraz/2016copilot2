JB has been reimbursed by Maquet Critical Care (Solna, Sweden) for attending several conferences; JB has participated as a speaker in scientific meetings or courses organized and financed by Maquet Critical Care; JB, through Neurovent Research, serves as a consultant for Maquet Critical Care. The following disclosure was agreed upon by the University of Toronto, Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre, St-Michaels Hospital and the REBs of Sunnybrook and St-Michaels to resolve conflicts of interest: Dr. Beck has made inventions related to neural control of mechanical ventilation that are patented. The patents are assigned to the academic institution(s) where inventions were made. The license for these patents belongs to Maquet Critical Care. Future commercial uses of this technology may provide financial benefit to Dr. Beck through royalties. Dr. Beck owns 50% of Neurovent Research Inc (NVR). NVR is a research and development company that builds the equipment and catheters for research studies. NVR has a consulting agreement with Maquet Critical Care. Disclosure for Institutional Conflict of Interest: St-Michaels Hospital has a research agreement with Maquet Critical Care AB (Solna, Sweden) and receives royalty and overhead from this agreement.
