Boyer is co-developer and author of the manuals ‘Plan My Life’ and ‘Solution Focused Treatment’: she receives royalties for the sales of both interventions. Saskia van der Oord has been a paid consultant for Janssen Pharmaceuticals in the development of a serious game “Healseeker”: aimed at training cognitive functions. Also, she is co-developer and author of the manuals ‘Plan My Life’ and ‘Solution Focused Treatment’. However, she has no financial interest in the sales of the interventions. She has been a speaker for Medice & Shire. Pier Prins is a member of the non-profit foundation Gaming & Training which develops and facilitates the computerized cognitive training programme Braingame Brian. Other authors declare no conflict of interest. This does not alter our adherence to PLOS ONE policies on sharing data and materials.","2016","03","Bianca E Boyer","BEB",6,TRUE,6,1,3,3,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,0,NA,FALSE
