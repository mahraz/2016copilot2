This manuscript shows the dangers of this drug in the setting of inflammation and fibrosis, since it worsens the problem. The authors have no other proprietary information on the drug, therefore everything they know about it can be shared and is being shared with the reader of the manuscript. The drug is not owned by the authors or this institution. It was obtained from British Biotech (United Kingdom), and the drug and all rights were transferred to Vernalis (United Kingdom). Since Vernalis owns this drug, an interested party may contact the company and work out an agreement with them to obtain the drug. This agreement is the material transfer agreement (MTA). This is a common practice with proprietary drugs that are not on the market. Any and all information the authors have about the drug is open for disclosure from the authors but, as mentioned, is all in the manuscript.","2010","06","Vincent E de Meijer","VEDM",8,TRUE,4,4,3,2,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,0,NA,FALSE
