Data collection was done by the participating centers and was collated by the CRO (Parexl) overseen by the consultant (AK), both funded by Bayer HealthCare. The statistical analysis was performed by (JJ), a consultant paid by Bayer HealthCare and was independently confirmed by (KB), a statistician working in the department of Biostatistics at Bayer HealthCAre. The decision to publish was made by the steering committee members (DG, Dl, AT, AR). The primary manuscript was written by (DG), although this was modified substantially according to the input received from each member of the author panel. JJ and AK served as consultants to, and were paid by, Bayer HealthCare. Intermountain HealthCare has no relationship with Bayer Health Care. Lampe Konieczny & Company is a private consulting firm and was hired by Bayer HealthCare for the purpose of overseeing this study. This study was funded in its entirety by Bayer HealthCare. All study sites received compensation for participation. This does not alter the authors adherence to all the PLoS ONE policies on sharing data and materials.","2011","11","Douglas S Goodin","DSG",9,TRUE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
