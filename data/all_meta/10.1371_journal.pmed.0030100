MZ and RK analyzed the data. MZ, MK, VHR, DC, JPR, and MCW collected data or carried out experiments for the study. CFS enrolled patients. MZ, VHR, DC, ZW, and RK contributed to writing the paper. DC participated in the electron microscopy studies and in situ zymography. JPR generated and provided the MMP-2 and MMP-9 double-knock-out mice used in this study and designed the conditions for their phenotypic and genotypic characterization. MCW conducted the experiments using Col4A3-deficient mice. ZW helped design the study and assisted with ZWs postdoctorate. J-PR assisted with cross-referencing. CFS provided nephrectomy specimens from patients with Alport syndrome and specimens from pre-renal-failure patients to help confirm portions of the theories.","The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.","2006","03","Michael Zeisberg","MZ",9,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
