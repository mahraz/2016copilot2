There was no direct accountability from the HiP lion research to the funders, there was no restriction from the funders on the work that could be conducted, and no restrictions on use of data from the funders. There was no commercial use of the HiP data for the funder. There is therefore no competing interest. Thus, this does not alter the authors adherence to PLOS ONE policies on sharing data and materials.","2014","06","Angela M Darnell","AMD",5,FALSE,5,3,1,1,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,0,NA,FALSE
