Tobias Sundberg: Institutional grants to I C – The Integrative Care Science Centre from the Mahle (Germany), Ekhaga (Sweden), Vidar (Sweden), Jochnick (the Netherlands) and Gyllenberg (Finland) charitable non-profit foundations, during the conduct of the study. Christina Forsberg: No competing interests exist. Torkel Falkenberg: Institutional grants from Ekhaga, Vidar, Mahle, Jochnick, and Gyllenberg Non Profit Charitable Foundations during the conduct of the study. In addition to being the research constellation leader of the integrative care research group at Karolinska Institutet he is also part time, the director of a charitable non-profit research foundation: I C – The Integrative Care Science Center. The part time work for IC has been scrutinized and is approved by Karolinska Institutet and is in line with the policies for this Governmental body in Sweden. I C is a unique Swedish forum focusing on complementary, alternative (CAM) and integrative care. The authors conduct research, training and communication activities. The homepage features current policy news, research news and their own service for critical analysis of CAM news in the mass media, CritiCAM. I C seeks to contribute to evidence-based health and health care development, including relevant elements of proven complementary, alternative and integrative medicine according to WHO recommendations. The primary target groups are certified health care professionals and decision-makers in Sweden. They do not provide individual patients with medical health care or advice but refer them to their respective physicians. Neither do they supply treatment recommendations in any way. Importantly, the statues for this Non-profit, Charitable Research Foundation, I C, to which they are only accountable to according to Swedish Law, states that they must carry out independent research. Hence, the authors financing bodies can not and may not influence them in any way. This does not alter the authors adherence to PLOS ONE policies on sharing data and materials.","2015","03","Susanne Andermo","SA",4,TRUE,2,3,4,4,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,0,NA,FALSE
