Prof. Madeleine Cunningham declares a conflict of interest as Chief Scientific Officer of Moleculera Labs, which is a start up company offering a panel of diagnostic immunological tests for diseases such as Sydenham chorea (SC) and Pediatric Acute Onset Neuropsychiatric Syndrome (PANS). Prof. Cunningham has filed for a provisional patent on her panel of assays with algorithm to detect autoantibodies against the brain in childhood diseases such as SC and PANS. Details are: provisional patent application for anti-neuronal antibody algorithm for autoantibodies in neuropsychiatric disorders with an application number of 61787919 filed on March 15, 2013.
