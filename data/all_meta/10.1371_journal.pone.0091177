In addition, GHL has received honoraria and paid travel expenses from Elanco Animal Health and Zoetis, and has served as a co-author with, and graduate advisor of, Elanco Animal Health personnel. DUT reports that Elanco Animal Health provided funds in support of the Beef Cattle Institute at Kansas State University of which DUT is the director. HMS reports no conflicts of interest related to either drug sponsor. The authors have no other competing interests such as employment, patents, products in development or marketed products.
