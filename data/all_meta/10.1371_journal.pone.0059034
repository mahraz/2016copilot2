Thomas Heel was an employee of this research center. The research program is decided in a scientific steering committee in which universities (as representatives of the government) and the companies are represented. The outcome of the research can be used by the industrial partners, however, they can also decide to give the results free for publication, which they did in this case. So the authors can declare that, \"This does not alter their adherence to all the PLOS ONE policies on sharing data and materials.\"","2013","03","Thomas Heel","TH",5,TRUE,2,3,5,2,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,0,NA,FALSE
