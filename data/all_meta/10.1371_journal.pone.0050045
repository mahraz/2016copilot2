The authors have received research funding for the employment of a technician and for some mouse expenses during one year from a commercial funder, Glugal Research/IP Finland, due to their interest of pursuing pending patent application of Oulu University concerning LH3 and adiponectin. However, the company has since withdrawn from the project as a result of change in their business strategy and has no rights for the presented results. There are no further patents, products in development or marketed products to declare.
