Annunziata Langella is currently an employe at Merck Serono and, Elena Capitò is currently an employe at BASF Italy. They do not hold any intellectual properties regarding the cholesterol tagged peptides and do not have any other competing interest. Anne Moscona and Matteo Porotto receive funds from NIH to study the antiviral properties of the fusion inhibitor peptides.
