Duca and D. Thorley-Lawson conceived, designed, and led the project. D. Thorley-Lawson wrote the paper. He provided the biological driving questions that motivated the development of PathSim, and contributed biological input at all stages of development and critical evaluation of output. K. Duca participated in model selection and design and helped write the paper. M. Shapiro managed software development and software quality assurance, contributed to evaluation of resulting output, and helped write this paper. E. Delgado-Eckert ran the simulation, organized output, and produced the graphs used in this paper. He also contributed intellectual content and helped write the paper. V. Hadinoto performed the biological experiments. A. Jarrah contributed to the design of PathSim. R. Laubenbacher provided input into simulation design and implementation. K. Lee wrote most of the simulation engine software. K. Luzuriaga provided clinical samples. N. Polys produced the visualization engine.","The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.","2007","10","Karen A Duca","KAD",10,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
