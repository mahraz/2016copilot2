JAJ, JFL, XW, JL, DI, AS, DEB, PS, and ERL collected data or did experiments for the study. JAJ, JFL, JL, AS, MM, ERL, and WH analyzed the data. JFL, JL, and XW participated in testing, validating the samples, and modification of the method. AS participated in the description of project methods by which the specimens were collected; collection/analysis of conventional sequencing data and behavioral data; and tracking and deleting specimens that were subsequently determined to be ineligible for the study. JAJ wrote the first draft of the paper. JAJ, DI, CC, DEB, MM, PS, ERL, and WH contributed to writing the paper. DI participated in the generation and communication to the primary author of a subset of the data used for the analysis; in the identification, preparation, and shipment of samples used by the laboratory of the primary author (JAJ) for the case-control study; and in the review of the manuscript summarizing the analysis of the results. CC provided characterized samples for the study in addition to intellectual input and approval of the final version of the document. DEB and AS contributed many of the sequences used in the cross-sectional study. DEB contributed to the cross-sectional study design. PS enrolled patients and was responsible for the collection and initial drug resistance analysis of diagnostic specimens from a subset of drug-na√Øve individuals used in the cross-sectional study. ERL played a significant role in the design of the analysis of clinical samples/data from the efavirenz trials used for this study; provided samples and data; and assisted in the analysis and interpretation of the case-control data.","JAJ and WH are named on a CDC patent application on the use of the real-time polymerase chain reaction assays presented in this article. CC and ERL were employees and stockholders in GlaxoSmithKline during the period of this study.
