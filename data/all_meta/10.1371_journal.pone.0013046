The funders of the work did not play any role in the research (determination of the objectives and aims, research plan design, etc.). The results obtained have not led to any patent or commercial product. None of the contributors has been or is an employee of the mentioned commercial entities. E. Lonchamp and L. Wioland have been supported by PhD grants of DGA, which belongs to the French Ministry of Defense, R. Courjaret was a post-doctoral fellow supported by a charity (AFM, i.e., French telethon), J. de Barry is a permanent staff member of INSERM (governmental), M. Popoff is employed by Institut Pasteur (nonprofit foundation), and all the other coauthors are CNRS (governmental) permanent staff. Thus, this does not alter the authors adherence to all the PLoS ONE policies on sharing data and materials.","2010","09","Etienne Lonchamp","EL",11,TRUE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
