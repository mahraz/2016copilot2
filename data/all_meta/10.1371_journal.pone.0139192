However, there are no patents, products in development or marketed products to declare, which is consistent with the Genographic Project protocol, which does not permit sponsors to commercially benefit from their support of the project. Furthermore, none of the funders had any role in the study design, data collection and analysis, decision to publish, or preparation of the manuscript.
