Jeff Smith are inventors on a patent application that is described in this, and other, manuscripts. The United States Patent and Trademark Office has not yet made a decision on the authors' application entitled \"Biological systems input-output response system and plant sentinels\"; patent application number 20090130697. In addition, June Medford and Kevin Morey are seeking to develop a company, Phytodetectors, Inc., related this work. At this time Phytodetectors Inc. has no funds, no funding, no facilities and no financial support. There was no contribution of any kind from Phytodetectors, Precision Biosciences (or any company) to the work described here.
