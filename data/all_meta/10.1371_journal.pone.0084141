Sandra’s work on this study however, has not been carried out under time compensated by this company and the company has no claims on any parts of the results/data. Moreover, Marine Monitoring is not involved in any work on ocean energy (other than offshore wind) and therefore by certainty has no particular interest in the results. Therefore, the affiliation of Sandra Andersson does not alter the authors adherence to all the PLOS ONE policies on sharing data and materials.","2013","12","Linus Hammar","LH",7,TRUE,7,6,6,6,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,0,NA,FALSE
