Conceived and designed the experiments: SS. Performed the experiments: SS. Analyzed the data: SS. Contributed reagents/materials/analysis tools: SS KBM. Wrote the paper: SS KBM.","Funding (in the form of a research contract from Boehringer Ingeliehim Pharmaceuticals, Inc. awarded to the Research Foundation of Stony Brook for KBM’s research) initially partially supported the generation of the conditional knockout mice used in this work. However, these mice were primarily generated for a separate study published in collaboration with the authors’ colleagues at Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (see Penzo, M., et al. 2010). The authors’ contract with Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals, Inc. expired in 2010 and they no longer participate in their research involving these IKK conditional mice. Thus the authors are free to use these mice in any new research projects that they may design and, importantly, provide them to scientific colleagues at their own discretion with no obligation or ties whatsoever to Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Neither KBM nor SS have ever been paid as Boehringer consultants. This does not alter the authors’ adherence to all the PLOS ONE policies on sharing data and materials.","2013","01","Sylvia Samaniego","SS",2,TRUE,1,1,1,2,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,0,NA,FALSE
