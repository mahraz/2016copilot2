Performed the experiments: HMH JK. Analyzed the data: HMH JK. Wrote the paper: HMH LEG MJG JK.","Some of co-authors own published work (JK, LEG) was included in the review of the evidence that was presented to the veterinary surgeons in this study. To minimize any impact, including the possibility of inhibiting participants from critically appraising and debating the evidence presented, the power point containing the evidence was delivered to participants by HMH, in the absence of either JK or LEG. Similarly, the group discussions were facilitated by HMH, in the absence of either JK/LEG. HMH took no part in producing any of the evidence presented in the review. The authors confirm that their conflict of interest statement does not alter their adherence to all the PLOS ONE polices on sharing data and materials.","2013","05","Helen M Higgins","HMH",4,TRUE,4,2,2,4,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,0,NA,FALSE
