Upon invention and disclosure, this intellectual property (IP) was assigned to the University of California. By policy, the University of California shares a fraction of income generated from licensing with the inventor. As such Maurice Garcia, M.D., MAS., has a financial interest in the IP described in the manuscript. However, to the present date, the University has not licensed the patent application or any portion of the IP therein, to any commercial interest. In addition, the University of California filed a U.S. Patent application for intellectual property (IP) related to the smartphone image-based measurement App, MedMeasure! Used in this work: U.S. Patent Number 61548750. This IP was licensed by author Maurice Garcia, as required by the University of California in order to proceed to program (create) the App and made it available ‚Ä as no such App currently exists. This App is currently available in iTunes and is free, though upgrades that allow one to perform measurements similar to those described in this manuscript (e.g. use of a non-standard object such as our fiducial markers to calibrate the caliper, does require an in-app purchase (cost‚Ää=‚Ää0.99 cents)). No other App currently available on iTunes or for Android smartphones affords the ability to measure actual distance on a 2-D camera image, and it is for this reason that the authors used the App designed by their group (MMG). The authors have added ‚ÄúPatents Pending‚Äù to the text to reflect the patents-pending status of the App. This does not alter the authors adherence to PLOS ONE policies on sharing data and materials, as detailed in the PLOS ONE Guide for Authors.","2014","03","Maurice M Garcia","MMG",7,TRUE,5,7,7,7,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,0,NA,FALSE
