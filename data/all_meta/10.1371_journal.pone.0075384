MGS and BB are advisors to the Department of Health and Health Protection Agency, England. PRM has received an unrestricted educational grant from Roche to conduct research in the area of pandemic influenza. However, the submitted paper is one work that is independent of this grant. JSNVT has received funding to attend influenza related meetings, lecture and consultancy fees and research funding from several influenza antiviral drug and vaccine manufacturers. All forms of personal remuneration ceased in September 2010, but research funding from GlaxoSmithKline, Astra-Zeneca and F Hoffmann-La Roche is on-going. He is a former employee of SmithKline Beecham plc. (now GlaxoSmithKline), Roche Products Ltd (UK) and Aventis-Pasteur MSD (now Sanofi-Pasteur MSD), all prior to 2005, with no remaining pecuniary interests by way of share holdings, share options and pension rights. WSL has received unrestricted research funding from Wyeth for an unrelated study of pneumococcal pneumonia. KGN, SJB, JEE, JM, PJMO, RCR, BLT have declared that no competing interests exist. None of the research funding for this particular study was from any of the several manufacturers mentioned or from GlaxoSmithKline, Astra-Zeneca and F Hoffmann-La Roche. This does not alter the authors adherence to all the PLOS ONE policies on sharing data and materials.","2013","09","Malcolm G Semple","MGS",12,FALSE,2,2,3,12,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,0,NA,FALSE
