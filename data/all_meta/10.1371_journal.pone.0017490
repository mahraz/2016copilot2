Schroth were employed by Illumina, Inc. at the time these experiments were carried out. Although all sequencing protocols were carried out on the Illumina Genome Analyzer, the central focus of this project is on library construction and data analysis, with no attempt to favor any particular next generation sequencing platform. Although they had roles in the study, this does not alter our adherence to all the PLoS ONE policies on sharing data and materials.","2011","02","Zhifu Sun","ZS",13,TRUE,3,3,2,2,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,0,NA,FALSE
