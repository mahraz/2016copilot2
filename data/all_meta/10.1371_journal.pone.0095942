Santams role in this study was to help select a suitable study site and then to mainstream the knowledge the authors generated into their organisation and the broader insurance sector. The authors would like to emphasize that, once the study site was chosen, Santam had no role in study design, data collection and analysis, decision to publish, or preparation of the manuscript. Santams interest in this study was not for direct financial gain, but rather to use as proof-of-concept to inform further in-house business research on how to improve risk assessment techniques in a changing world. Both organizations in the collaboration (Santam and CSIR) committed similar amounts of funding, and the relationship with Santam insurance and the authors can be more correctly described as a knowledge partnership than a client-customer relationship. The authors would also like to emphasize that the collaboration with Santam insurance does not alter their adherence to PLOS ONE policies on sharing data and materials regarding this manuscript.","2014","05","Jeanne L Nel","JLN",14,TRUE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
