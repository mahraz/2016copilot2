Significant critical input: KBH BAG.","Authors Keith Hoffman, Christina Kraus, and Mo Dimbil work for Adverse Events, Inc. which produced the RxFilter software used in this paper. There is no financial conflict regarding the focus of the paper: That there are adverse event reports for statins within the FDA AERS database is not in dispute; and there is no rationale by which this company affiliation would bias a comparative analysis of agents within a class, such as that presented. Although the software will not be made available, the methods have been elucidated by which the results can be replicated without this software. This does not alter the authors' adherence to all the PLoS ONE policies on sharing data and materials.","2012","08","Keith B Hoffman","KBH",4,TRUE,1,3,2,2,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,0,NA,FALSE
