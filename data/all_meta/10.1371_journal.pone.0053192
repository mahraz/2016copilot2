In addition, Bristol-Myers Squibb does have an interest in developing an inhibitor of 11Beta-Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenase Type 1, the experimental gene described in the manuscript entitled; 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 gene knockout attenuates atherosclerosis and in vivo foam cell formation in hyperlipidemic apoE−/− mice. Patents protecting the intellectual property around the inhibitors are in process. However, no inhibitors, experimental or otherwise, were used in the studies described in this manuscript. There are no further patents, products in development or marketed products to declare. This does not alter the authors adherence to all the PLOS ONE policies on sharing data and materials.","2013","02","Ricardo A García","RAG",24,TRUE,8,16,19,2,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,0,NA,FALSE
