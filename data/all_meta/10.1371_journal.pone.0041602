There is no product development or marketing of products by these companies. Both are authorized to acquire public research funds. Research work in particular of ERDE AAK-Diagnostik GmbH led to the formation of the research group Autoimmunity and G Protein-Coupled Receptors at the Max Delbrueck Center for Molecular Medicine headed by Dr. Bimmler who is executive director of ERDE AAK-Diagnostik GmbH and member of the executive board of ERDE eV. The European Community Grant No. 10145576 to Dr. Bimmler as research group leader supports a common research project of the Max Delbrueck Center for Molecular Medicine and of ERDE AAK-Diagnostik GmbH.
