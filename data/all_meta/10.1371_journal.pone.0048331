Programming the environment: J-MN CW BG BS.","The authors in the paper who are employed by the company Guger Technologies are Bernhard Grosswindhager and Christoph Guger. The main business of that company is brain-computer interfaces (www.gtec.at). In the work described in this paper, these authors were responsible for implementing the robot controller. Dr Guger, the director of Guger Technologies, has sent the corresponding author an email stating that there is “no conflict of interest with the publication as it was done for research purposes.” There is a small commercial relationship between Guger Technologies and the University of Barcelona (UB). UB licenses to Guger Technologies a system that controls a virtual character that can be moved by the company’s brain-computer interface system. This has nothing to do with the work described in the present paper. Taking into account all of the above this does not alter the authors' adherence to all the PLOS ONE policies on sharing data and materials.","2012","10","Jean-Marie Normand","JMN",10,TRUE,3,2,1,6,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,0,NA,FALSE
