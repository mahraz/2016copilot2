The experiments for this publication were done in cooperation with the commercial company BIOSERV GmbH. The company provided the equipment for the Bioassay in order to test the biological activity of plant-made C5a. That is why, the employees of BIOSERV, which were involved in the Bioassay experiments, were listed as co-authors. There are not any competing interests between the University of Rostock and BIOSERV, since this study was done as cooperation project. All authors are informed about and agreed with the submitted manuscript. None of the authors from the University of Rostock have been employed by BIOSERV at any time. Furthermore, there are no patents, products in development or marketed products etc., which compete with the manuscript. Hence, this does not alter the authors adherence to all the PLOS ONE policies on sharing data and materials.","2012","12","Henrik Nausch","HN",6,TRUE,3,1,4,3,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,0,NA,FALSE
