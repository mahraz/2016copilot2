This does not alter the authors adherence to all the PLOS ONE policies on sharing data and materials. The authors Andrea Babelova PhD and Ralf P. Brandes MD, on behalf of Sanofi and Dr. Matthias Loehn confirm that researchers wishing to replicate the results presented here will be provided access to SAR407899 (ie. that the tech transfer department at Sanofi is willing to share SAR407899 for non-commercial research purposes).","2013","11","Andrea Babelova","AB",14,TRUE,5,5,8,3,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,0,NA,FALSE
