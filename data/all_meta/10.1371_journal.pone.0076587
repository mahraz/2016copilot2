We would like to emphasize that three of the authors of the article are employed in Centrum HTA Sp z o.o. Sp komandytowa but that fact does not alter our adherence to all the PLoS One policies on sharing data and materials because the Centrum HTA was never involved in assessment of any of antiretroviral drugs; what is more Centrum HTA never co-operated with Boehringer Ingelheim which is trade owner of nevirapine (trade name Viramune). Authors of the article have no private or professional connection with neither Boehringer Ingelheim nor another pharmaceutical company involved in HIV drug investigation, development or manufacturing.","2013","10","Pawe≈Ç Kawalec","P≈K",4,TRUE,2,2,3,2,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,0,NA,FALSE
