Geue LEM. Performed the experiments: KMG LEM. Analyzed the data: PVL KMG DC D. Geue D. Grönemeyer. Contributed reagents/materials/analysis tools: D. Geue. Contributed to the writing of the manuscript: PVL KMG DC D. Geue LEM D. Grönemeyer.","The authors confirm that Daniel Geue is an employee of Visus Technology Transfer GmbH. The contribution of Dr. Geue in the submitted work was to help in the interpretation of the data. Dr. Geue was a long-standing member of the authors staff until 2009 and has made substantial contributions to similar work previously published by the authors group. His expertise and advice helped the authors understand, analyze and interpret the results of the present study. The content of his contribution was in no way directly related to his work at Visus, and Visus has and will in no way directly benefit financially from Dr. Geues contribution. Also, the data availability is not compromised by Dr. Geues involvement in the study as the data originated from other contributors (Kathleen M. Gustafson, Linda E. May). To the authors knowledge there are also no other non-financial, professional or personal conflicts of interest. So in summary, Dr. Geues employment status does not alter the authors adherence to PLOS ONE policies on sharing data and materials.","2014","08","Peter Van Leeuwen","PVL",6,TRUE,4,2,4,NA,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,0,NA,FALSE
