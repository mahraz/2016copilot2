There are no further patents, products in development or marketed products to declare. This does not alter the authors' adherence to all the PLOS ONE policies on sharing data and materials, as detailed online in the guide for authors. The authors' method is still in review by the technology transfer. Therefore no official patent application still exists. The authors so far suggest the title: “Method for automatic adaptive focusing of cytological slides by image quality control”.","2013","04","Bernd Lahrmann","BL",5,TRUE,3,1,2,4,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,0,NA,FALSE
