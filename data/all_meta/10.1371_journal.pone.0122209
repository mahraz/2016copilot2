Maltzman are employees of Morphotek, developers of the FOLR1 antibody farletuzumab and as such have received support in the form of salaries from Morphotek. Daniel J. O’Shannessy and Julia D. Maltzman did not have any additional role in the data collection and analysis, manuscript preparation or decision to publish. However, both were involved in minor aspects of study design by providing protocols and technical advice on staining tissues for folate receptor expression (Fig. 3). Data collection, data interpretation, manuscript preparation and the decision to publish resided exclusively with Mayo Clinic investigators. The inclusion of Daniel J. O’Shannessy and Julia D. Maltzman as coauthors does not alter the authors adherence to PLOS One policies on sharing data and materials.","2015","03","Brian M Necela","BMN",18,TRUE,5,7,7,2,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,0,NA,FALSE
