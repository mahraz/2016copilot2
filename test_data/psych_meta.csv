None of the authors have any financial, personal, or professional interests that could be construed to have influenced their paper. Bayer Schering AG has ceased any further research on ZK200775 and there are no further products in development that are related to ZK200775. As far as the authors know, Bayer Schering AG has no patent on ZK200775 any more and there are no products marketed that are related to ZK200775. The trial was funded by Bayer Schering AG and was accomplished in 1997. At that time, the development of ZK200775 and other AMPA-antagonists for the treatment of cerebral ischemia was very promising. Finally, research on ZK200775 as a therapeutic agent was ceased since there were life-threatening side-effects that could not be eliminated. Bayer Schering AG currently has no interests in any further development of the AMPA-antagonist ZK200775. Thomas Staks, as an employee of Bayer Schering AG, only took part in the design of the study. The data presented here was collected, analysed and prepared exclusively by Klaus R√ºther and Richard Bergholz. Both are independent researchers and are not affiliated to Bayer Schering AG. Any bias due to competing interests is impossible. The authors assure that the role of Bayer Schering AG does not compromise their adherence to all the PLoS ONE policies on sharing data and materials.
